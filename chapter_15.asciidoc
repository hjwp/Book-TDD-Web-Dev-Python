User Authentication, Integrating Third-Party Plugins, and Mocking with JavaScript
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

((("authentication")))
((("user authentication", see="authentication")))
Our beautiful lists site has been live for a few days, and our users are
starting to come back to us with feedback.  "We love the site", they say, "but
we keep losing our lists.  Manually remembering URLs is hard. It'd be great if
it could remember what lists we'd started".

Remember Henry Ford and faster horses. Whenever you hear a user requirement,
it's important to dig a little deeper and think--what is the real requirement
here?  And how can I make it involve a cool new technology I've been wanting
to try out?

Clearly the requirement here is that people want to have some kind of user
account on the site.  So, without further ado, let's dive into authentication.

Naturally we're not going to mess about with remembering passwords ourselves--besides being 'so' 90s, secure storage of user passwords is a security
nightmare we'd rather leave to someone else.  We'll use a federated
authentication system instead.

(If you 'insist' on storing your own passwords, Django's default auth
module is ready and waiting for you. It's nice and straightforward, and I'll
leave it to you to discover on your own.)

((("authentication", "mocking", see="mocks/mocking")))
((("mocks/mocking", "in JavaScript")))
In this chapter, we're going to get pretty deep into a testing
technique called "mocking". Personally, I know it took me a few weeks to
really get my head around mocking, so don't worry if it's confusing at first.
In this chapter we do a lot of mocking in JavaScript.  In the next chapter
we'll do some mocking with Python, which you might find a little easier to 
grasp.  I would recommend reading both of them through together, and just
letting the whole concept wash over you; then come back and do them again,
and see if you understand all of the steps a little better on the second round.

NOTE: Do let me know via obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com if you feel there's
any particular sections where I don't explain things well, or where I'm 
going too fast.


Mozilla Persona (BrowserID)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Mozilla Persona")))
((("Persona")))
((("authentication", "Mozilla Persona")))
But which federated authentication system to use?  Oauth?  Openid?  "Login with
Facebook"?   Ugh.  In my book those all have unacceptable creepy overtones;
why should Google or Facebook know what sites you're logging into and when?
Thankfully there are still some techno-hippy-idealists out there, and the
lovely people at Mozilla have cooked up a privacy-friendly auth mechanism
they call "Persona", or sometimes ||"BrowserID".||

The theory goes that your web browser acts as a third party between the
website that wants to check your ID, and the website that you will use
as a guarantor of your ID.  The latter may be Google or Facebook or whomever,
but a clever protocol means that they never need know which website you were
logging into or when.

Ultimately, Persona may never take off as an authentication platform, but
the main lessons from the next couple of chapters should be relevant no matter
what third-party auth system you want to integrate:

* Don't test other people's code or APIs.
* But, test that you've integrated them correctly into your own code.
* Check that everything works from the point of view of the user.
* Test that your system degrades gracefully if the third party is down.
//TODO: except I don't actually go into that last, do I?


Exploratory Coding, aka "Spiking"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("JavaScript", "spiking with", seealso="spiking", id="ix_javaspiking", range="startofrange")))
((("spiking", "with JavaScript", id="ix_spikingjava", range="startofrange")))
((("spiking", id="ix_spiking", range="startofrange")))
((("exploratory coding", seealso="spiking")))
Before I wrote this chapter all I'd seen of Persona was a talk at PyCon by Dan
Callahan, in which he promised it could be implemented in 30 lines of code, and
magic'd his way through a demo--in other words, I knew it not at all.

In <<manual-validation-chapter>> and <<simple-form-chapter>> we saw that you can
use a unit test as a way of exploring a
new API, but sometimes you just want to hack something together without any
tests at all, just to see if it works, to learn it or get a feel for it.
That's absolutely fine.  When learning a new tool or exploring a new possible
solution, it's often appropriate to leave the rigorous TDD process to one side,
and build a little prototype without tests, or perhaps with very few tests.
The goat doesn't mind looking the other way for a bit.

This kind of prototyping activity is often called a "spike", for 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/249969/why-are-tdd-spikes-called-spikes[reasons
best known].

((("Django-BrowserID")))
The first thing I did was take a look at an existing  Django-Persona
integration called
https://github.com/mozilla/django-browserid[Django-BrowserID], but
unfortunately it didn't really support Python 3.  I'm sure it will by the time
you read this, but I was quietly relieved since I was rather looking forward to
writing my own code for this! 

It took me about three hours of hacking about, using a combination of code stolen
from Dan's talk and the example code on the
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona[Persona site], but by
the end I had something which just about works.  I'll take you on a tour,
and then we'll go through and "de-spike" the implementation.  

You should go ahead and add this code to your own site too, and then you can
have a play with it, try logging in with your own email address, and convince
yourself that it really does work.


Starting a Branch for the Spike
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before embarking on a spike, it's a good idea to start a new branch, so you
can still use your VCS without worrying about your spike commits getting mixed
up with your production code:

[role="dofirst-ch15l000"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git checkout -b persona-spike*
----


Frontend and JavaScript Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("spiking", "frontend and JavaScript code")))
Let's start with the frontend.  I was able to cut and paste code from the
Persona site and Dan's slides with minimal modification:


[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch15l001)
[source,html]
----
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="/static/list.js"></script>
<script src="https://login.persona.org/include.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function() {

var loginLink = document.getElementById('login');
if (loginLink) {
  loginLink.onclick = function() { navigator.id.request(); };
}

var logoutLink = document.getElementById('logout');
if (logoutLink) {
  logoutLink.onclick = function() { navigator.id.logout(); };
}

var currentUser = '{{ user.email }}' || null;
var csrf_token = '{{ csrf_token }}';
console.log(currentUser);

navigator.id.watch({
  loggedInUser: currentUser,
  onlogin: function(assertion) {
    $.post('/accounts/login', {assertion: assertion, csrfmiddlewaretoken: csrf_token})
    .done(function() { window.location.reload(); })
    .fail(function() { navigator.id.logout();});
  },
  onlogout: function() {
    $.post('/accounts/logout')
    .always(function() { window.location.reload(); });
  }
});

});
</script>
----

The Persona JavaScript library gives us a special `navigator.id` object.
We bind its `request` method to our link called "login" (which I've put
in any old where at the top of the page), and similarly a "logout" link 
gets bound to a `logout` function:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch15l002)
[source,html]
----
<body>
<div class="container">

    <div class="navbar">
        {% if user.email %}
            <p>Logged in as {{ user.email}}</p>
            <p><a id="logout" href="{% url 'logout' %}">Sign out</a></p>
        {% else %}
            <a href="#" id="login">Sign in</a>
        {% endif %}
        <p>User: {{user}}</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
    [...]
----

The Browser-ID Protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("spiking", "browser-ID protocol")))
Persona will now pop up its authentication dialog box if users
click the log in link. What happens next is the clever part of the Persona
protocol:  the user enters an email address, and the browser takes care
of validating that email address, by taking the user to the email provider
(Google, Yahoo, or whoever), and validating it with them. 

Let's say it's Google: Google asks the user to confirm their username and
password, and maybe even does some two-factor auth wizardry, and is then
prepared to confirm to your browser that you are who you say you are.  Google
then passes a certificate back to the browser, which is cryptographically
signed to prove it's from Google, and which contains the user's email address.

At this point the browser can trust that you do own that email address, and
it can incidentally reuse that certificate for any other websites that use
Persona.

Now it combines the certificate with the domain name of the website
you want to log into in to a blob called an "assertion", and sends them on
to our site for validation.

This is the point between the `navigator.id.request` and the
`navigator.id.watch` callback for ++onlogin++&mdash;we send the assertion via
POST to the login URL on our site, which I've put at 'accounts/login'.

On the server, we now have the job of verifying the assertion: is it really
proof that the user owns that email address?  Our server can check, because
Google has signed part of the assertion with its public key.  We can either
write code to do the crypto for this step ourselves, or we can use a public
service from Mozilla to do it for us.

NOTE: Yes, letting Mozilla do it for us totally defeats the whole privacy
point, but it's the 'principle'. We could do it ourselves if we wanted to.
It's left as an exercise for the reader!  There are more details on the 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona/Protocol_Overview[Mozilla
site], including all the clever public key crypto that keeps Google from 
knowing what site you want to log in to, but also stops replay attacks and
so on. Smart.


The Server Side: Custom Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("spiking", "server-side authentication", id="ix_spikingssa", range="startofrange")))
((("authentication","customising", id="ix_authcust", range="startofrange")))
((("Django", "authentication in", id="ix_Djangoauth", range="startofrange")))
Next we prep an app for our accounts stuff:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python3 manage.py startapp accounts*
----

Here's the view that handles the POST to 'accounts/login':

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.accounts/views.py
[source,python]
----
import sys
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate
from django.contrib.auth import login as auth_login
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def login(request):
    print('login view', file=sys.stderr)
    # user = PersonaAuthenticationBackend().authenticate(request.POST['assertion'])
    user = authenticate(assertion=request.POST['assertion'])
    if user is not None:
        auth_login(request, user)
    return redirect('/')
----

You can see that it's clearly "spike" code from things like the commented-out
line, evidence of an early experiment that failed.

Here's the `authenticate` function, which is implemented as a custom
Django "authentication backend". (We could have done it inline in the view,
but using a backend is the Django recommended way.  It would let us reuse the
authentication system in the admin site, for example.)

++++
<?hard-pagebreak?>
++++

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.accounts/authentication.py
[source,python]
----
import requests
import sys
from accounts.models import ListUser

class PersonaAuthenticationBackend(object):

    def authenticate(self, assertion):
        # Send the assertion to Mozilla's verifier service.
        data = {'assertion': assertion, 'audience': 'localhost'}
        print('sending to mozilla', data, file=sys.stderr)
        resp = requests.post('https://verifier.login.persona.org/verify', data=data)
        print('got', resp.content, file=sys.stderr)

        # Did the verifier respond?
        if resp.ok:
            # Parse the response
            verification_data = resp.json()

            # Check if the assertion was valid
            if verification_data['status'] == 'okay':
                email = verification_data['email']
                try:
                    return self.get_user(email)
                except ListUser.DoesNotExist:
                    return ListUser.objects.create(email=email)


    def get_user(self, email):
        return ListUser.objects.get(email=email)
----

This code is copy-pasted directly from the Mozilla site, as you can see from
the explanatory comments.  

You'll need to `pip install requests` into your virtualenv.  If you've never
used it before, http://docs.python-requests.org/[Requests] is a great
alternative to the Python standard library tools for HTTP requests.

To finish off the job of customising authentication in Django, we just need a
custom user model:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/models.py
[source,python]
----
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin
from django.db import models

class ListUser(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField(primary_key=True)
    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    #REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['email', 'height']

    objects = ListUserManager()

    @property
    def is_staff(self):
        return self.email == 'harry.percival@example.com'

    @property
    def is_active(self):
        return True
----

That's what I call a minimal user model!  One field, none of this
firstname/lastname/username nonsense, and, pointedly, no password! 
Somebody else's problem!   But, again, you can see that this code isn't ready
for production, from the commented-out lines to the hardcoded harry
email address.

NOTE: At this point I'd recommend a little browse through the 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/auth/customizing/[Django 
auth documentation].

Aside from that, you need a model manager for the user:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.accounts/models.py (ch15l006)
[source,python]
----
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager, PermissionsMixin

class ListUserManager(BaseUserManager):

    def create_user(self, email):
        ListUser.objects.create(email=email)

    def create_superuser(self, email, password):
        self.create_user(email)
----

A logout view:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/views.py (ch15l007)
[source,python]
----
from django.contrib.auth import login as auth_login, logout as auth_logout
[...]

def logout(request):
    auth_logout(request)
    return redirect('/')
----

Some URLs for our two views:

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/urls.py (ch15l008)
[source,python]
----
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^$', 'lists.views.home_page', name='home'),
    url(r'^lists/', include('lists.urls')),
    url(r'^accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),
    # url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
)
----

and

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/urls.py
[source,python]
----
from django.conf.urls import patterns, url

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^login$', 'accounts.views.login', name='login'),
    url(r'^logout$', 'accounts.views.logout', name='logout'),
)
----


(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_spikingssa")))
(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_authcust")))
(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_Djangoauth")))
Almost there. We switch on the auth backend and our new accounts app in
'settings.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py
[source,python]
----
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    #'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'lists',
    'accounts',
)

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.ListUser'
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'accounts.authentication.PersonaAuthenticationBackend',
)

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
[...]
----

And a quick `makemigrations` to make the new user model real:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'accounts':
  0001_initial.py:
    - Create model ListUser
----

And a `migrate` to build the database:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python3 manage.py migrate*
[...]
Running migrations:
  Applying accounts.0001_initial... OK
----

And we should be all done! Why not spin up a dev server with `runserver` and
see how it all looks (<<persona-login-working>>)?

[[persona-login-working]]
.It works! It works! Mwahahahaha.
image::images/twdp_1501.png["The Persona login screen"]


((("debugging", "Ajax")))
That's pretty much it! Along the way, I had to fight pretty hard, including
debugging Ajax requests by hand in the Firefox console (see
<<debugging-ajax>>), catching infinite page-refresh loops, stumbling over
several missing attributes on my custom user model (because I didn't read the
docs properly), and even one point switching to the dev version of Django to
overcome a bug, which thankfully turned out to be irrelevant.

TIP: If it's not working when you try it manually, and you see "audience
mismatch" errors in the console, make sure you're visiting the site
via 'http://localhost:8000', and not '127.0.0.1'.
((("spiking", "logging")))

.Aside: Logging to stderr
*******************************************************************************
While spiking, it's pretty critical to be able to see exceptions that are being
generated by your code. Annoyingly, Django doesn't send all exceptions to the 
terminal by default, but you can make it do so with a variable called `LOGGING`
in 'settings.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch15l011)
[source,python]
----
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
        },
    },
    'root': {'level': 'INFO'},
}
----

Django uses the rather "enterprisey" logging module from the Python standard
library, which, although very fully featured, does suffer from a fairly steep
learning curve. It's covered a little more in <<testfixtures-and-logging>>, 
and in the https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/logging/[Django docs].
*******************************************************************************

But we now have a working solution!  Let's commit it on our spike branch:
(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_javaspiking")))

Time to de-spike!


De-spiking
~~~~~~~~~~

((("De-spiking")))
((("spiking", "de-spiking")))
((("functional tests/testing (FT)", "for de-spiking", sortas="despiking")))
((("JavaScript", "de-spiking in")))
De-spiking means rewriting your prototype code using TDD.  We now have enough
information to "do it properly".  So what's the first step?  An FT of course!

We'll stay on the spike branch for now, to see our FT pass against our spiked
code.  Then we'll go back to master, and commit just the FT.

Here's the basic outline:

[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/test_login.py
[source,python]
----
from .base import FunctionalTest

class LoginTest(FunctionalTest):

    def test_login_with_persona(self):
        # Edith goes to the awesome superlists site
        # and notices a "Sign in" link for the first time.
        self.browser.get(self.server_url)
        self.browser.find_element_by_id('login').click()

        # A Persona login box appears
        self.switch_to_new_window('Mozilla Persona')  #<1>

        # Edith logs in with her email address
        ## Use mockmyid.com for test email
        self.browser.find_element_by_id(
            'authentication_email'  #<2>
        ).send_keys('edith@mockmyid.com') #<3>
        self.browser.find_element_by_tag_name('button').click()

        # The Persona window closes
        self.switch_to_new_window('To-Do')

        # She can see that she is logged in
        self.wait_for_element_with_id('logout')  #<1>
        navbar = self.browser.find_element_by_css_selector('.navbar')
        self.assertIn('edith@mockmyid.com', navbar.text)
----

<1> The FT needs a couple of helper functions, both of which do something
    that's very common in Selenium testing:  they wait for something to happen.
    Listings for them follow.

<2> I found the ID of the Persona login box by opening the site manually,
    and using the Firefox debug toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+I). See
    <<firefox-debug-persona>>.

<3> Rather than using a "real" email address and having to click through 
    their authentication screens, we use a "fake" provider.
    http://mockmyid.com[MockMyID] is one; you can also check out
    http://personatestuser.org[Persona Test User].
    ((("MockMyID")))
    ((("Persona")))



.Evaluate Third-Party Systems' Test Infrastructure
*******************************************************************************

((("evaluating third-party systems")))
((("payment systems, testing for")))
Testing should be part of how you evaluate third-party systems.  When you
integrate with an external service, you're going to have to think through how
you're going to work with it in your functional tests.

Often you can just use the same service in your tests and in "real life".  But
sometimes you're going to want to run against a "test" version of the third-party service.  In the case of this integration with Persona, we could have
used a "real" email address; when I first wrote this chapter, I actually had an
FT that clicked through to Yahoo.com, and logged in with a throwaway account
I'd created. The problem is that it made the FT totally reliant on particular
details of Yahoo's email login screens, which can change at any time.

Instead, MockMyID and PersonaTestUser are both linked to from the Persona
documentation, and they work very smoothly, letting us test just the important
parts of the integration.

Perhaps more critically, think about payment systems.  If you start integrating
payments, they're going to be one of the most important parts of your site, and
you're going to want to make sure they're tested thoroughly ... but you don't
want to be putting actual transactions on real credit cards through, every time
you run an FT!  So most providers will provide a "test" version of their
payments API. These vary in quality (naming no names), so make sure you
investigate them thoroughly.

A Common Selenium Technique: Explicit Waits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Selenium", "wait patterns")))
((("waits")))
((("explicit waits")))
Here's the first of the two "wait" helper functions:

[role="dofirst-ch15l013 sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/test_login.py (ch15l014)
[source,python]
----
import time
[...]

    def switch_to_new_window(self, text_in_title):
        retries = 60
        while retries > 0:
            for handle in self.browser.window_handles:
                self.browser.switch_to_window(handle)
                if text_in_title in self.browser.title:
                    return
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)
        self.fail('could not find window')
----

In this one we've "rolled our own" wait--we iterate through all the
current browser windows, looking for one with a particular title. If
we can't find it, we do a short wait, and try again, decrementing a retry
counter.

This is such a common pattern in Selenium tests that the team created an API
for waiting--it doesn't quite handle all use cases though, so that's why we 
had to roll our own the first time around.  When doing something simpler like
waiting for an element with a given ID to appear on the page, we can use the
`WebDriverWait` class:


[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/test_login.py (ch15l015)
[source,python]
----
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
[...]

    def wait_for_element_with_id(self, element_id):
        WebDriverWait(self.browser, timeout=30).until(
            lambda b: b.find_element_by_id(element_id)
        )
----

This is what Selenium calls an "explicit wait".  If you remember, we
already defined an "implicit wait" in `FunctionalTest.setUp`.  We set that
to just three seconds, which is fine in most cases, but when we're waiting
for an external service like Persona, we sometimes need to bump that default
timeout.

There are more examples in the 
http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp[Selenium docs], but I
actually found reading the 
http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/py/selenium/webdriver/support/wait.py[source
code] more instructive--there are good docstrings!

TIP: `implicitly_wait` is unreliable, especially once JavaScript is involved. 
    Prefer the "wait-for" pattern in your FT whenever you need to check for
    asynchronous interactions on your pages.  We'll see this again in
    <<CI-chapter>>.

And if we run the FT, it works!

and reintroduce them one by one in a test-driven way.


Reverting Our Spiked Code

$ *rm -rf accounts* # remove any trace of spiked code
$ *git add functional_tests/test_login.py*

Now we rerun the FT and let it drive our development:

selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: 'Unable to locate

----

The first thing it wants us to do is add a login link. Incidentally, I prefer
prefixing HTML IDs with `id_`; it's a convention to make it easy to tell
the difference between classes and IDs in HTML and CSS. So let's tweak the FT
first:

[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/test_login.py (ch15l017)
[source,python]
----
    self.browser.find_element_by_id('id_login').click()

----


Next a "do-nothing" login link.  Bootstrap has some built-in classes for
navigation bars, so we'll use them:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html
[source,html]
----

    <nav class="navbar navbar-default" role="navigation">

JavaScript Unit Tests Involving External Components:  Our First Mocks!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get our FT further, we're going to need to get the Persona window
to pop up. For that, we'll need to de-spike our client-side JavaScript
code that uses the Persona libraries.  We'll test-drive that using 
JavaScript unit tests and mocking.


Housekeeping: A Site-Wide Static Files Folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("static folder, site-wide")))
A bit of housekeeping first: create a site-wide static files directory inside
'superlists/superlists', and move all the Bootsrap CSS, QUnit code, and
'base.css' into it, so it looks like this:

// $ *mkdir -p superlists/static/tests*
// $ *git mv lists/static/bootstrap superlists/static*
// $ @git mv lists/static/tests/qunit.* superlists/static/tests@
// $ *git mv lists/static/base.css superlists/static*

TIP: Always do a commit before and after a bit of housekeeping like this.

That means adjusting our existing JavaScript unit tests:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html (ch15l020)
[source,html]
----
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../../superlists/static/tests/qunit.css">

    <script src="../../../superlists/static/tests/qunit.js"></script>
    <script src="../list.js"></script>
----

And we check they still work, by opening them up in a browser:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
2 assertions of 2 passed, 0 failed.
----

Here's how we tell our settings file about the new static folder:

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py
[source,python]
----
[...]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '../static')
STATICFILES_DIRS = (
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'superlists', 'static'),
)
----

NOTE: I recommend reintroducing the `LOGGING` setting from earlier at this 
point.  There's no need for an explicit test for it; our current test
suite will let us know in the unlikely event that it breaks anything. As we'll
find out in <<testfixtures-and-logging>>, it'll be useful for debugging later.

And we can quickly run the layout + styling FT to check the CSS all still works:

[role="dofirst-ch15l021-1"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests.test_layout_and_styling*]
[...]
OK
----

Next, create an app called `accounts` to hold all the code related to
login.  That will include our Persona JavaScript stuff:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python3 manage.py startapp accounts*
$ *mkdir -p accounts/static/tests*
----

That's the housekeeping done.  Now's a good time for a commit.  Then, let's
take another look at our spiked-in javascript:

[role="skipme"]
[source,javascript]
----
var loginLink = document.getElementById('login');
if (loginLink) {
  loginLink.onclick = function() { navigator.id.request(); };
}
----

Mocking: Who, Why, What?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("mocks/mocking", "in JavaScript", id="ix_mockingjava", range="startofrange")))
We want our login link's on-click to be bound to a function provided by
the Persona library, `navigator.id.request`.

Now we don't want to call the 'actual' third-party function in our unit tests,
because we don't want our unit tests popping up Persona windows all over the
shop.  So instead, we are going to do what's called "mocking it out": creating
a "fake" or "mock" implementation of the third-party API for our tests to run
against.

What we're going to do is replace the real `navigator` object with a 'fake'
one that we've built ourselves, one that will be able to tell us what happens
to it.

NOTE: I had hoped that our first Mock example was going to be in Python, but it
    looks like it's going to be JavaScript instead.  Needs must.  You may find
    you it's worth rereading the rest of the chapter a couple of times after
    you get to the end of it, to let it all sink in.


Namespacing
^^^^^^^^^^^

((("namespacing")))
((("mocks/mocking", "namespacing")))
In the context of 'base.html', `navigator` is just an object in the global
scope, as provided by the 'include.js' `<script>` tag that we get from 
Mozilla.  Testing global variables is a pain though, so we can turn it 
into a local variable by passing it into an 
"initialize"footnote:[UK-English speakers may bristle at that incorrect
spelling of the word "initialise". I know, it grates with me too. But it's an
increasingly accepted convention to use American spelling in code. It makes it
easier to search, for example, and just to work together more generally,  if we
all agree on how words are spelt.  We have to accept that we're in the minority
here, and this is one battle we've probably lost.]
function. The code we'll end up with in 'base.html' will look like this:


[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.lists/templates/base.html
[source,html]
----
<script src="/static/accounts/accounts.js"></script>
<script>
    $(document).ready(function() {

        Superlists.Accounts.initialize(navigator)

    });
</script>
----

I've specified that our `initialize` function will be 'namespaced' inside
some nested objects, `Superlists.Accounts`.  JavaScript suffers from a
programming model that's tied into a global scope, and this sort of
namespacing/naming convention helps to keep things under control.  Lots of
JavaScript libraries might want to call a function `initialize`, but very few
will call it 
`Superlists.Accounts.initialize`!footnote:[The new shiny in the JavaScript
world for avoiding namespacing problems is called 'require.js'.  It was one
thing too many to squeeze into this book, but you should check it out.]

This call to `initialize` is simple enough that I'm happy it doesn't need any
unit tests of its own.



A Simple Mock to Unit Tests Our initialize Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("mocks/mocking", "initialize function test", id="ix_mockinginitialize", range="startofrange")))
The `initialize` function itself we 'will' test.  Copy the lists
tests across to get the boilerplate HTML, and then adjust the following:

[role="dofirst-ch15l023 sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html
[source,html]
----
    <div id="qunit-fixture">
        <a id="id_login">Sign in</a>
    </div>

    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="../../../superlists/static/tests/qunit.js"></script>
    <script src="../accounts.js"></script>
    <script>
/*global $, test, equal, sinon, Superlists */

test("initialize binds sign in button to navigator.id.request", function () {
    var requestWasCalled = false; //<6>
    var mockRequestFunction = function () { requestWasCalled = true; }; //<5>
    var mockNavigator = { //<4>
        id: {
            request: mockRequestFunction
        }
    };

    Superlists.Accounts.initialize(mockNavigator); //<3>

    $('#id_login').trigger('click'); //<2>

    equal(requestWasCalled, true); //<1>
});

    </script>
----
//ch15l024

//TODO: check the syntax highlighting on this segment, and in chapter in
// general. 

One of the best ways to understand this test, or indeed any test, is to work 
backwards.  The first thing we see is the assertion:

<1> We are asserting that a variable called `requestWasCalled` is `true`. We're
    checking that, one way or another, the `request` function, as in
    `navigator.id.request`, was called.

<2> Called when?  When a click event happens to the `id_login` element.

<3> Before we trigger that click event, we call our 
    `Superlists.Accounts.initialize` function, just like we will on the real
    page. The only difference is, instead of passing it the real global
    `navigator` object from Persona, we pass in a fake one called
    ++mockNavigator++.footnote:[I've called this object a "mock", but it's probably more correctly
called a "spy". We don't have to concern ourselves with the differences in
this book, but for more on the general class of tools called "Test Doubles",
including the difference between stubs, mocks, fakes, and spies, see
https://leanpub.com/mocks-fakes-stubs[Mocks, Fakes and Stubs] by Emily Bache.]

<4> That's defined as a generic JavaScript object, with an attribute called
    `id` which in turn has an attribute called `request`, which we're assigning
    to a variable called `mockRequestFunction`.

<5> `mockRequestFunction` we define as a very simple function, which if called
    will simply set the value of the `requestWasCalled` variable to `true`.

<6> And finally (firstly?) we make sure that `requestWasCalled` starts out
    as `false`.

The upshot of all this is:  the only way this test will pass is if our
`initialize` function binds the `click` event on `id_login` to the method
`.id.request` of the object we pass it.  If we get the tests passing when
we use the mock object, we are reassured that our `initialize` function 
will also do the right thing when we give it a real object on our real
page.

Does that make sense?  Let's play around with the test and see if we can 
get the hang ||of it.||


TIP: When testing events on DOM elements, you need an actual element to trigger
events against, and to register listeners on.  If you forget, it's a
particularly fiendish test bug, because `.trigger` will just silently no-op,
and you'll be left scratching your head about why it's not working. So don't
forget to add the `<div id="id_login">` inside the `qunit-fixture` div!


Our first error is this:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
1. Died on test #1
@file:///workspace/superlists/accounts/static/tests/tests.html:35:
Superlists is not defined
----

That's the equivalent of an `ImportError` in Python.  Let's start work
on 'accounts/static/accounts.js':


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js
[source,javascript]
----
window.Superlists = null;
----

We start with the usual on-document-ready boilerplate, and then address our
immediate problem: `Superlists` is not defined.  Now, just as in Python we
might do `Superlists = None`, here we do `window.Superlists = null`.  Using
`window.` makes sure we get the global object:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
1. Died on test #1
@file:///workspace/superlists/accounts/static/tests/tests.html:35:
Superlists is null
----

OK, next baby step 
or two:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js
[source,javascript]
----
window.Superlists = {
    Accounts: {}
};
----

gives:footnote:[In the real world, when setting up a namespace like
this, you'd want to follow a sort of "add-or-create" pattern, so that, if there's
already a `window.Superlists` in the scope, we extend it rather than replacing it.
`window.Superlists = window.Superlists || {}` is one formulation, and jQuery's `$.extend` 
is another possibilty.  But, there's already a lot of content in this chapter, and
I thought this was probably one too many things to talk about!]

[role="qunit-output"]
----
Superlists.Accounts.initialize is not a function
----

So let's make it a function:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js
[source,javascript]
----
window.Superlists = {
    Accounts: {
        initialize: function () {}
    }
};
----

And now we get a real test failure instead of just errors:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
1. initialize binds sign in button to navigator.id.request (1, 0, 1)

    1. failed
        Expected: true
        Result: false
----

Next--let's separate defining our `initialize` function from the part where we
export it into the `Superlists` namespace.  We'll also do a `console.log`, which
is the JavaScript equivalent of a debug-print, to take a look at what the
initialize function is being called with:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js (ch15l028)
[source,javascript]
----
var initialize = function (navigator) {
    console.log(navigator);
};

window.Superlists = {
    Accounts: {
        initialize: initialize
    }
};
----


((("JavaScript", "debug console")))
((("debugging", "in JavaScript")))
In Firefox and I believe Chrome also, you can use the shortcut Ctrl-Shift-I
to bring up the JavaScript console, and see the [object Object] that was logged
(see <<javascript-console>>).  If you click on it, you can see it has the
properties we defined in our test: an `id`, and inside that, a function called
`request`.


[[javascript-console]]
.Debugging in the JavaScript console
image::images/twdp_1504.png["The JavaScript console in our qunit run, showing the console.log"]

So let's now just pile in and get the test to pass:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js (ch15l029)
[source,javascript]
----
var initialize = function (navigator) {
    navigator.id.request();
};
----

That gets the tests to pass, but it's not quite the implementation we
want.  We're calling `navigator.id.request` always, instead of only
on click.  We'll need to adjust our tests.

[role="qunit-output"]
----
1 assertions of 1 passed, 0 failed.
1. initialize binds sign in button to navigator.id.request (0, 1, 1)
----

Before we do, let's just have a play around to see if we really understand
what's going on.  What happens if we do this?


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js (ch15l029-1)
[source,javascript]
----
var initialize = function (navigator) {
    navigator.id.request();
    navigator.id.doSomethingElse();
};
----

We get:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
1. Died on test #1
@file:///workspace/superlists/accounts/static/tests/tests.html:35:
navigator.id.doSomethingElse is not a function
----

You see, the mock navigator object that we pass in is entirely under our
control. It has only the attributes and methods we give it.  You can
play around with it now if you like:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html
[source,html]
----
    var mockNavigator = {
        id: {
            request: mockRequestFunction,
            doSomethingElse: function () { console.log("called me!");}
        }
    };
----

That will give you a pass, and if you open up the debug window, you'll see:

[role="skipme"]
----
[01:22:27.456] "called me!"
----
//IDEA: get phantomjs runner to capture console.logs

Does that help to see what's going on?  Let's revert those last two changes,
and tweak our unit test so that it checks the `request` function is only
called 'after' we fire off the click event.  We also add some error messages
to help see which of the two `equal` assertions is failing:


[role="dofirst-ch15l029-2 sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html (ch15l032)
[source,html]
----
    var mockNavigator = {
        id: {
            request: mockRequestFunction
        }
    };
    Superlists.Accounts.initialize(mockNavigator);
    equal(requestWasCalled, false, 'check request not called before click'); 
    $('#id_login').trigger('click');
    equal(requestWasCalled, true, 'check request called after click'); 
----

NOTE: Assertion messages (the third argument to `equal`), in QUnit, are
actually "success" messages. Rather than only being displayed if the test
fails, they are also displayed when the test passes.  That's why they have
the positive phrasing.
((("assertion messages")))
((("QUnit")))

Now we get a neater failure:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
1 assertions of 2 passed, 1 failed.
1. initialize binds sign in button to navigator.id.request (1, 1, 2)
    1. check request not called before click
        Expected: false
        Result: true
----

So let's make it so that the call to `navigator.id.request` only happens
if our `id_login` is clicked:

A quick check on the FT ... doesn't get any further unfortunately.  To see
why, we can open up the site manually, and check the JavaScript debug console:

[role="skipme"]
----
[01:36:54.572] Error: navigator.id.watch must be called before
navigator.id.request @ https://login.persona.org/include.js:8
----
//IDEA: test this somehow?


More Advanced Mocking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now need to call Mozilla's `navigator.id.watch` correctly. Taking another
look at our spike, it should be something like this:


[role="skipme small-code"]
[source,javascript]
----
var currentUser = '{{ user.email }}' || null;
var csrf_token = '{{ csrf_token }}';
console.log(currentUser);

navigator.id.watch({
  loggedInUser: currentUser, //<1>
  onlogin: function(assertion) {
    $.post('/accounts/login', {assertion: assertion, csrfmiddlewaretoken: csrf_token}) //<2>
    .done(function() { window.location.reload(); })
    .fail(function() { navigator.id.logout();});
  },
  onlogout: function() {
    $.post('/accounts/logout')
    .always(function() { window.location.reload(); });
  }
});
----

((("watch function")))
Decoding that, the `watch` function needs to know a couple of things from 
the global scope:  

<1> The current user's email, to be passed in as the `loggedInUser` parameter
    to `watch`.

<2> The current CSRF token, to pass in the Ajax POST request to the login
    view.footnote:[Incidentally, notice we use `{{ csrf_token }}` which gives you
the raw string token, rather than `{% csrf_token%}` which would give us
a full HTML tag, `<input type="hidden" name="etc etc`.]

We've also got two hardcoded URLs in there, which would be better to
get from Django, something like this:

[role="skipme"]
[source,javascript]
----
var urls = {
    login: "{% url 'login' %}",
    logout: "{% url 'logout' %}",
};
----

So that would be a third parameter to pass in from the global scope.  We've
already got an `initialize` function, so let's imagine using it like this:

[role="skipme"]
[source,javascript]
-----
Superlists.Accounts.initialize(navigator, user, token, urls);

((("mocks/mocking", "sinon.js")))
((("sinon.js")))
"Rolling your own" mocks is possible as we've seen, and JavaScript actually
makes it relatively easy, but using a mocking library can save us a lot of
heavy lifting.  The most popular one in the JavaScript world is called
'sinon.js'. Let's download it (from http://sinonjs.org) and put it in our
site-wide static tests folder:

[role="dofirst-ch15l036"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *tree superlists/static/tests/*
superlists/static/tests/
├── qunit.css
├── qunit.js
└── sinon.js
----

Next we include it in our accounts tests:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html
[source,html]
----
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="../../../superlists/static/tests/qunit.js"></script>
    <script src="../../../superlists/static/tests/sinon.js"></script>
    <script src="../accounts.js"></script>
----

And now we can write a test that uses Sinon's mock object:footnote:[Sinon also has more specialised objects for "spies" and "stubs".
Mocks can do everything that spies and stubs can do though, so I figured, 
one less piece of terminology would keep things simple.]

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html (ch15l038)
[source,javascript]
----
test("initialize calls navigator.id.watch", function () {
    var user = 'current user';
    var token = 'csrf token';
    var urls = {login: 'login url', logout: 'logout url'};
    var mockNavigator = { 
        id: { 
            watch: sinon.mock() //<1>
        } 
    };

    Superlists.Accounts.initialize(mockNavigator, user, token, urls);

    equal(
        mockNavigator.id.watch.calledOnce, //<2>
        true,
        'check watch function called'
    );
});
----

<1> We create a mock navigator object as before, but now instead of
    hand-crafting a function to mock out the function we're interested in, we
    use a `sinon.mock()` object.

<2> This object then records what happens to it inside special properties like
    `calledOnce`, which we can make assertions against.

There's more info in the Sinon docs--the http://sinonjs.org/[front page] 
actually has quite a good overview.

Here's our expected test failure:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
2 assertions of 3 passed, 1 failed.

1. initialize binds sign in button to navigator.id.request (0, 2, 2)
2. initialize calls navigator.id.watch (1, 0, 1)
    1. check watch function called
        Expected: true
        Result: false
----

We add in the call to `watch`...

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js
[source,javascript]
----
var initialize = function (navigator) {
    $('#id_login').on('click', function () {
        navigator.id.request();
    });

    navigator.id.watch();
};
----

But that breaks the other test!

[role="qunit-output skipme"]
----
1 assertions of 2 passed, 1 failed.

1. initialize binds sign in button to navigator.id.request (1, 0, 1)
    1. Died on test #1
@file:///workspace/superlists/accounts/static/tests/tests.html:36:
missing argument 1 when calling function navigator.id.watch

2. initialize calls navigator.id.watch (0, 1, 1)
----
//IDEA: go back to testing this if slimerjs ever works again //did you do this?

That was a puzzler--that "missing argument 1 when calling function
navigator.id.watch" took me a while to figure out.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/watch[Turns
out that], in Firefox, `.watch` is a function on every object.  We'll need to
mock it out in the previous test too:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html
[source,html]
----
test("initialize binds sign in button to navigator.id.request", function () {
    var requestWasCalled = false;
    var mockRequestFunction = function () { requestWasCalled = true; };
    var mockNavigator = {
        id: {
            request: mockRequestFunction,
            watch: function () {}
        }
    };
    [...]
----


And we're back to passing tests:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
3 assertions of 3 passed, 0 failed.

1. initialize binds sign in button to navigator.id.request (0, 2, 2)
2. initialize calls navigator.id.watch (0, 1, 1)
----


Checking Call Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("mocks/mocking", "checking call arguments")))
We're not calling the `watch` function correctly yet--it needs to know
the current user, and we have to set up a couple of callbacks for login
and logout.  Let's start with the user:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html (ch15l042)
[source,html]
----
test("watch sees current user", function () {
    var user = 'current user';
    var token = 'csrf token';
    var urls = {login: 'login url', logout: 'logout url'};
    var mockNavigator = {
        id: {
            watch: sinon.mock()
        }
    };

    Superlists.Accounts.initialize(mockNavigator, user, token, urls);
    var watchCallArgs = mockNavigator.id.watch.firstCall.args[0];
    equal(watchCallArgs.loggedInUser, user, 'check user');
});
----

We have a very similar setup (which is a code smell incidentally--on
the next test, we're going to want to do some de-duplication of test
code).  Then we use the `.firstCall.args[0]` property on the mock to check
on the parameter we passed to the `watch` function (`args` being a list of 
positional arguments). That gives us:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
3. watch sees current user (1, 0, 1)
    1. Died on test #1
@file:///workspace/superlists/accounts/static/tests/tests.html:72:
watchCallArgs is undefined
----

because we're not currently passing any arguments to `watch`.  Step by step,
we can do:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js (ch15l043)
[source,javascript]
----
    navigator.id.watch({});
----


and get a clearer error message:


[role="qunit-output"]
----
3. watch sees current user (1, 0, 1)
    1. check user
        Expected: "current user"
        Result: undefined 
----

and fix it thusly:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js (ch15l044)
[source,javascript]
----
var initialize = function (navigator, user, token, urls) {
    [...]

    navigator.id.watch({
        loggedInUser: user
    });
----

Good.

[role="qunit-output"]
----
4 assertions of 4 passed, 0 failed.
----



QUnit setup and teardown, Testing Ajax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Fake XMLHttpRequest")))
((("QUnit")))
((("sinon.js")))
Next we need to check the `onlogin` callback, which is called when Persona
has some user authentication information, and we need to send it up to our
server for validation.  That involves an Ajax call (`$.post`), and they're
normally quite hard to test, but sinon.js has a helper called
http://sinonjs.org/docs/#server[fake XMLHttpRequest].

This patches out the native JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest` class, so it's good
practice to make sure we restore it afterwards.  This gives us a good
excuse to learn about QUnit's `setup` and `teardown` methods--they
are used in a function called `module`, which acts a bit like a 
`unittest.TestCase` class, and groups all the tests that follow it
together.

.Aside on Ajax
*******************************************************************************
((("Ajax")))
If you've never used Ajax before, here is a very brief overview.  You may find
it useful to read up on it elsewhere before proceeding though.

Ajax stands for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML", although the XML part is a bit
of a misnomer these days, since everyone usually sends text or JSON rather
than XML.  It's a way of letting your client-side JavaScript code send and
receive information via the HTTP protocol (GET and POST requests), but do so
"asynchronously", ie, without blocking and without needing to reload the page.

Here we're going to use Ajax requests to send a POST request to our login
view, sending it the assertion information from the Persona UI.  We'll use the
http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/[jQuery Ajax convenience functions].
*******************************************************************************


Let's add this "module" after the first test, before the test for
`"initialize calls navigator.id.watch"`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html (ch15l045)
[source,html]
----
var user, token, urls, mockNavigator, requests, xhr; //<1>
module("navigator.id.watch tests", {
    setup: function () {
        user = 'current user'; //<2>
        token = 'csrf token';
        urls = { login: 'login url', logout: 'logout url' };
        mockNavigator = { 
            id: { 
                watch: sinon.mock()
            }
        };
        xhr = sinon.useFakeXMLHttpRequest(); //<3>
        requests = []; //<4>
        xhr.onCreate = function (request) { requests.push(request); }; //<4>
    },
    teardown: function () {
        mockNavigator.id.watch.reset(); //<5>
        xhr.restore(); //<6>
    }
});

test("initialize calls navigator.id.watch", function () {
    [...]
----

<1> We pull out the variables `user`, `token`, `urls`, etc. up to a higher scope,
    so that they'll be available to all of the tests in the file.

<2> We initialise said variables inside the `setup` function, which, just
    like a `unittest` `setUp` function, will run before each test.  That
    includes our `mockNavigator`.

<3> We also invoke Sinon's `useFakeXMLHttpRequest`, which patches out 
    the browser's Ajax capabilities.

<4> There's one more bit of boilerplate:  we tell Sinon to take any Ajax
    requests and put them into the `requests` array, so that we can inspect
    them in our tests.

<5> Finally we have the cleanup--we "reset" the mock for the `watch` function
    in between each test (otherwise calls from one test would show up in others).

<6> And we put the JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest` back to the way we found it.


That lets us rewrite our two tests to be much shorter:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html (ch15l046)
[source,html]
----
test("initialize calls navigator.id.watch", function () {
    Superlists.Accounts.initialize(mockNavigator, user, token, urls);
    equal(mockNavigator.id.watch.calledOnce, true, 'check watch function called');
});


test("watch sees current user", function () {
    Superlists.Accounts.initialize(mockNavigator, user, token, urls);
    var watchCallArgs = mockNavigator.id.watch.firstCall.args[0];
    equal(watchCallArgs.loggedInUser, user, 'check user');
});
----

And they still pass, but their name is neatly prefixed with our module
name:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
4 assertions of 4 passed, 0 failed.

1. initialize binds sign in button to navigator.id.request (0, 2, 2)
2. navigator.id.watch tests: initialize calls navigator.id.watch (0, 1, 1)
3. navigator.id.watch tests: watch sees current user (0, 1, 1)
----

And here's how we test the `onlogin` callback:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html (ch15l047)
[source,html]
----
test("onlogin does ajax post to login url", function () {
    Superlists.Accounts.initialize(mockNavigator, user, token, urls);
    var onloginCallback = mockNavigator.id.watch.firstCall.args[0].onlogin; //<1>
    onloginCallback(); //<2>
    equal(requests.length, 1, 'check ajax request'); //<3>
    equal(requests[0].method, 'POST');
    equal(requests[0].url, urls.login, 'check url');
});

test("onlogin sends assertion with csrf token", function () {
    Superlists.Accounts.initialize(mockNavigator, user, token, urls);
    var onloginCallback = mockNavigator.id.watch.firstCall.args[0].onlogin;
    var assertion = 'browser-id assertion';
    onloginCallback(assertion);
    equal(
        requests[0].requestBody,
        $.param({ assertion: assertion, csrfmiddlewaretoken: token }), //<4>
        'check POST data'
    );
});
----

<1> The mock we set on the mock navigator's watch function lets us extract the
    callback function we set as "onlogin."

<2> We can then actually call that function in order to test it.

<3> Sinon's `fakeXMLHttpRequest` server will catch any Ajax requests we make,
    and put them into the `requests` array.  We can then check on things
    like whether it was a POST and what URL it was sent to.

<4> The actual POST parameters are held in `.requestBody`, but they are
    URL-encoded (using the &key=val syntax).  jQuery's `$.param` function
    does URL-encoding, so we use that to do our comparison.
    

And the two tests fail as expected:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
4. navigator.id.watch tests: onlogin does ajax post to login url (1, 0, 1)
    1. Died on test #1
@file:///workspace/superlists/accounts/static/tests/tests.html:78:
onloginCallback is not a function

5. navigator.id.watch tests: onlogin sends assertion with csrf token (1, 0, 1)
    1. Died on test #1
@file:///workspace/superlists/accounts/static/tests/tests.html:90:
onloginCallback is not a function
----

Another unit-test/code cycle.  Here's the failure messages I went through:

[role="dofirst-ch15l048 qunit-output"]
----
1. check ajax request
Expected: 1
----

...

[role="dofirst-ch15l049 qunit-output"]
----
3. check url
Expected: "login url"
----

...

[role="dofirst-ch15l050 qunit-output"]
----
7 assertions of 8 passed, 1 failed.
1. check POST data
Expected: 
"assertion=browser-id+assertion&csrfmiddlewaretoken=csrf+token"
Result: null
----

...

[role="dofirst-ch15l051 qunit-output"]
----
1. check POST data
Expected: 
"assertion=browser-id+assertion&csrfmiddlewaretoken=csrf+token"
Result: "assertion=browser-id+assertion"
----

...

[role="dofirst-ch15l052 qunit-output"]
----
8 assertions of 8 passed, 0 failed.
----

And I ended up with this code:

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js
[source,javascript]
----
    navigator.id.watch({
        loggedInUser: user,
        onlogin: function (assertion) {
            $.post(
                urls.login, 
                { assertion: assertion, csrfmiddlewaretoken: token }
            );
        }
    });
----


Logout
++++++

At the time of writing, the "onlogout" part of the watch API's status was
uncertain.  It works, but it's not necessary for our purposes.  We'll just make
it a do-nothing function, as a placeholder. Here's a minimal test for that:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html (ch15l053)
[source,html]
----
test("onlogout is just a placeholder", function () {
    Superlists.Accounts.initialize(mockNavigator, user, token, urls);
    var onlogoutCallback = mockNavigator.id.watch.firstCall.args[0].onlogout;
    equal(typeof onlogoutCallback, "function", "onlogout should be a function");
});
----

And we get quite a simple logout function:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js (ch15l054)
[source,javascript]
----
    },
    onlogout: function () {}
});
----

More Nested Callbacks!  Testing Asynchronous Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("mocks/mocking", "callbacks", id="ix_mockingcallbacks", range="startofrange")))
((("asynchronous JavaScript", id="ix_asynchcode", range="startofrange")))
((("sinon.js")))
This is what JavaScript's all about folks!  Thankfully, sinon.js really does
help.  We still need to test that our login `post` methods 'also' set some
callbacks for things to do 'after' the POST request comes back:

[role="skipme"]
[source,javascript]
----
    .done(function() { window.location.reload(); })
    .fail(function() { navigator.id.logout();});
----

I'm going to skip testing the `window.location.reload`, because it's a bit
unnecessarily complicated,footnote:[You can't mock out `window.location.reload`, so instead you have to 
define an (untested) function called `Superlists.Accounts.refreshPage`, and
then put a mock on 'that' to check that it gets set as the Ajax `.done` callback.] and I think we can allow that this will be tested by our Selenium test.  We
will do a test for the on-fail callback though, just to demonstrate that it is
possible:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/tests/tests.html (ch15l055)
[source,html]
----
test("onlogin post failure should do navigator.id.logout ", function () {
    mockNavigator.id.logout = sinon.mock(); //<1>
    Superlists.Accounts.initialize(mockNavigator, user, token, urls);
    var onloginCallback = mockNavigator.id.watch.firstCall.args[0].onlogin;
    var server = sinon.fakeServer.create(); //<2>
    server.respondWith([403, {}, "permission denied"]); //<3>

    onloginCallback();
    equal(mockNavigator.id.logout.called, false, 'should not logout yet');

    server.respond(); //<4>
    equal(mockNavigator.id.logout.called, true, 'should call logout');
});
----

<1> We put a mock on the `navigator.id.logout` function which we're interested
    in.

<2> We use Sinon's `fakeServer`, which is an abstraction on top of the 
    `fakeXMLHttpRequest` to simulate Ajax server responses.

<3> We set up our fake server to respond with a 403 "permission denied"
    response, to simulate what will happen for unauthorized users.

<4> We then explicitly tell the fake server to send that response. Only
    then should we see the logout call.


That gets us to this--a slight change to our spiked code:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js (ch15l056)
[source,javascript]
----
    onlogin: function (assertion) {
        $.post(
            urls.login,
            { assertion: assertion, csrfmiddlewaretoken: token }
        ).fail(function () { navigator.id.logout(); });
    },
    onlogout: function () {}
----

Finally we add our `window.location.reload`, just to check it doesn't break any
unit tests:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/static/accounts.js (ch15l057)
[source,javascript]
----
    navigator.id.watch({
        loggedInUser: user,
        onlogin: function (assertion) {
            $.post(
                urls.login,
                { assertion: assertion, csrfmiddlewaretoken: token }
            )
                .done(function () { window.location.reload(); })
                .fail(function () { navigator.id.logout(); });
        },
        onlogout: function () {}
    });
----

Everything's still OK:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
11 assertions of 11 passed, 0 failed.
----

If those chained `.done` and `.fail` calls are bugging you--they bug me a
little--you can rewrite that as, eg:

[role="skipme"]
[source,javascript]
----
    var deferred = $.post(
        urls.login,
        { assertion: assertion, csrfmiddlewaretoken: token }
    );
    deferred.done(function () { window.location.reload(); })
    deferred.fail(function () { navigator.id.logout(); });
----

But async code is always a bit mind-bending.  I find it just about readable
as it is:  "do a post to urls.login with the assertion and csrf token, when
it's done, do a window reload, or if it fails, do a navigator.id.logout". You
can read up on  JavaScript deferreds, aka "promises",
http://otaqui.com/blog/1637/introducing-javascript-promises-aka-futures-in-google-chrome-canary/[here].

We're approaching the moment of truth:  will our FTs get any further? First,
we adjust our `initialize` call:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html
[source,html]
----
<script>
    /*global $, Superlists, navigator */
    $(document).ready(function () {
        var user = "{{ user.email }}" || null;
        var token = "{{ csrf_token }}";
        var urls = {
            login: "TODO",
            logout: "TODO",
        };
        Superlists.Accounts.initialize(navigator, user, token, urls);
    });
</script>
----

And we run the FT...

.On Spiking and Mocking with JavaScript
*******************************************************************************

Spiking::
    Exploratory coding to find out about a new API, or to explore the
    feasibility   of a new solution.  Spiking can be done without tests.  It's
    a good idea to do your spike on a new branch, and go back to master when
    de-spiking.
    ((("spiking")))

Mocking::
    We use mocking in unit tests when we have an external dependency that we
    don't want to actually use in our tests.  A mock is used to simulate the 
    third-party API.   Whilst it is possible to "roll your own" mocks in
    JavaScript, a mocking framework like Sinon provides a lot of helpful
    shortcuts which will make it easier to write (and more importantly, read)
    your tests.

Unit testing Ajax::
    Sinon is a great help here. Manually mocking Ajax methods is a real
    pain.
