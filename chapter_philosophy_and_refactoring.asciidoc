What Are We Doing with All These Tests? (And, Refactoring)
----------------------------------------------------------

((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "need for", id="TDDneed04")))Now
that we've seen the basics of TDD in action, it's time to pause
and talk about why we're doing it.


I'm imagining several of you, dear readers, have been holding back
some seething frustration--perhaps some of you have done a bit of unit
testing before, and perhaps some of you are just in a hurry. You've been
biting back questions like:

* Aren't all these tests a bit excessive?

* Surely some of them are redundant? There's duplication between
  the functional tests and the unit tests.

* I mean, what are you doing importing `django.urls.resolve` in your
  unit tests?  Isn't that testing Django--that is, testing third-party code? I
  thought that was a no-no?

* Those unit tests seemed way too trivial--testing one line of declaration,
  and a one-line function that returns a constant! Isn't that just a waste of
  time? Shouldn't we save our tests for more complex things?

* What about all those tiny changes during the unit-test/code cycle?  Surely we
  could have just skipped to the end? I mean, `home_page = None`!? Really?

* You're not telling me you 'actually' code like this in real life?

Ah, young grasshopper. I too was once full of questions like these.  But only
because they're perfectly good questions.  In fact, I still ask myself
questions like these, all the time. Does all this stuff really have value? Is
this a bit of a cargo cult?

Programming Is Like Pulling a Bucket of Water Up [keep-together]#from a Well#
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "philosophy of", "bucket of water analogy")))Ultimately, programming is hard.  Often, we are smart, so we succeed.  TDD is
there to help us out when we're not so smart.  Kent Beck (who basically
invented TDD) uses the metaphor of lifting a bucket of water out of a well
with a rope:  when the well isn't too deep, and the bucket isn't very full,
it's easy. And even lifting a full bucket is pretty easy at first.  But after a
while, you're going to get tired. TDD is like having a ratchet that lets you
save your progress, take a break, and make sure you never slip backwards.  That
way you don't have to be smart 'all' the time.

image::images/twp2_0401.png["Test ALL the things",float="right"]


OK, perhaps 'in general', you're prepared to concede that TDD is a good
idea, but maybe you still think I'm overdoing it?  Testing the tiniest thing,
and taking ridiculously many small steps?

TDD is a 'discipline', and that means it's not something that comes naturally;
because many of the payoffs aren't immediate but only come in the longer term,
you have to force yourself to do it in the moment. That's what the image of the
Testing Goat is supposed to illustrate--you need to be a bit bloody-minded
about it.

[role="pagebreak-before less_space"]
.On the Merits of Trivial Tests for Trivial Functions
**********************************************************************
In the short term it may feel a bit silly to write tests for simple
functions and [keep-together]#constants#.  

It's perfectly possible to imagine still doing
``mostly'' TDD, but following more relaxed rules where you don't unit test
'absolutely' everything.  But in this book my aim is to demonstrate full,
rigorous TDD. Like a kata in a martial art, the idea is to learn the motions
in a controlled context, when there is no adversity, so that the techniques
are part of your muscle memory. It seems trivial now, because we've started
with a very simple example. The problem comes when your application gets
complex--that's when you really need your tests.  And the danger is that
complexity tends to sneak up on you, gradually.  You may not notice it
happening, but quite soon you're a boiled frog.

There are two other things to say in favour of tiny, simple tests for simple
functions.

Firstly, if they're really trivial tests, then they won't take you that long to
write them. So stop moaning and just write them already.

Secondly, it's always good to have a placeholder.  Having a test 'there' for a
simple function means it's that much less of a psychological barrier to
overcome when the simple function gets a tiny bit more complex--perhaps it
grows an `if`. Then a few weeks later it grows a `for` loop. Before you know
it, it's a recursive metaclass-based polymorphic tree parser factory.  But
because it's had tests from the very beginning, adding a new test each time has
felt quite natural, and it's well tested.  The alternative involves trying to
decide when a function becomes ``complicated enough'', which is highly
subjective, but worse, because there's no placeholder, it seems like that
much more effort, and you're tempted each time to put it off a little longer,
and pretty soon--frog soup!


Instead of trying to figure out some hand-wavy subjective rules for when
you should write tests, and when you can get away with not bothering, I suggest
following the discipline for now--as with any discipline, you have to take the
time to learn the rules before you can break them.

Using Selenium to Test User Interactions

((("Selenium", "testing user interactions with", id="Suser04")))((("user interactions", "testing with Selenium", id="UIselenium04")))Where
were we at the end of the last chapter? Let's rerun the test and find
out:

Did you try it, and get an error saying 'Problem loading page' or
'Unable to connect'?  So did I. It's because we forgot to spin up the dev
server first using `manage.py runserver`.  Do that, and you'll get the failure
message we're after.

NOTE: One of the great things about TDD is that you never have to worry about
    forgetting what to do next--just rerun your tests and they will tell

//IDEA: stop using id_new_item, just use name=

<1> We're using several of the methods that Selenium provides to examine web
    pages: `find_element_by_tag_name`, `find_element_by_id`, and
    pass:[<code>find&#x2060;_ele&#x2060;ment&#x2060;<strong>s</strong>&#x2060;_by&#x2060;_&#x200b;tag_name</code>] (notice the extra `s`, which means it will
    return several elements rather than just one).  

<2> We also use `send_keys`, which is Selenium's way of typing into input
    elements. 

<3> The `Keys` class (don't forget to import it) lets us send special keys
    like Enter.footnote:[You could also just use the string +"\n"+, but `Keys` 
    also lets you send special keys like Ctrl so I thought I'd show it.]

<4> When we hit Enter, the page will refresh. The `time.sleep` is there to make
    sure the browser has finished loading before we make any assertions about
    the new page.  This is called an "explicit wait" (a very simple one; we'll
    improve it in <<chapter_explicit_waits_1>>).

TIP: Watch out for the difference between the Selenium `find_element_...`
    and `find_elements_...` functions.  One returns an element and raises
    an exception if it can't find it, whereas the other returns a list, which
    may be empty.



Also, just look at that `any` function. It's a little-known Python built-in.
I don't even need to explain it, do I? Python is such a joy.



((("generator expressions")))((("list comprehensions")))Although, if you're one of my readers who doesn't know Python, what's happening
inside the `any` is a 'generator expression', which is like a 'list
comprehension' but awesomer. You need to read up on this. If you Google it,
you'll find http://bit.ly/1iXxD18[Guido himself explaining it nicely].
Come back and tell me that's not pure joy!

Let's see how it gets on:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python functional_tests.py*]
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: h1

Decoding that, the test is saying it can't find an `<h1>` element on the page.
Let's see what we can do to add that to the HTML of our home page.

((("", startref="Suser04")))((("", startref="UIselenium04")))Big
changes to a functional test are usually a good thing to commit on their
own. I failed to do so in my first draft, and I regretted it later when I
changed my mind and had the change mixed up with a bunch of others.  The more
atomic your commits, the better:

The ``Don't Test Constants'' Rule, and Templates to the Rescue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


((("“Don’t Test Constants” rule", primary-sortas="Don’t Test Constants rule")))((("unit tests", "“Don’t Test Constants” rule", secondary-sortas="Don’t Test Constants rule")))Let's
take a look at our unit tests, 'lists/tests.py'.  Currently we're looking
for specific HTML strings, but that's not a particularly efficient way of
testing HTML.  In general, one of the rules of unit testing is 'Don't test
constants', and testing HTML as text is a lot like testing a constant.

In other words, if you have some code that says:


[source,python]
----
wibble = 3
----

There's not much point in a test that says:

[source,python]
----
from myprogram import wibble
assert wibble == 3
----

Unit tests are really about testing logic, flow control, and configuration.
Making assertions about exactly what sequence of characters we have in our HTML
strings isn't doing that.

What's more, mangling raw strings in Python really isn't a great way of dealing
with HTML.  There's a much better solution, which is to use templates.  Quite
apart from anything else, if we can keep HTML to one side in a file whose name
ends in '.html', we'll get better syntax highlighting! There are lots of Python
templating frameworks out there, and Django has its own which works very well.
Let's use that.




Refactoring to Use a Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



((("unit tests", "refactoring in", id="UTrefactor04")))((("refactoring", id="refactor04")))What
we want to do now is make our view function return exactly the same HTML,
but just using a different process. That's a refactor--when we try to
improve the code 'without changing its functionality'.

That last bit is really important. If you try to add new functionality at the
same time as refactoring, you're much more likely to run into trouble.
Refactoring is actually a whole discipline in itself, and it even has a
reference book: Martin Fowler's http://refactoring.com/[_Refactoring_].

The first rule is that you can't refactor without tests.  Thankfully, we're doing
TDD, so we're way ahead of the game.  Let's check that our tests pass; they will
be what makes sure that our refactoring is behaviour preserving:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py test*
[...]
OK
----

Great! We'll start by taking our HTML string and putting it into its own file.
Create a directory called 'lists/templates' to keep templates in, and then open
a file at 'lists/templates/home.html', to which we'll transfer our 
HTML:footnote:[Some people like to use another subfolder named after the app
(i.e., 'lists/templates/lists') and then refer to the template as
'lists/home.html'.  This is called "template namespacing". I figured it was
overcomplicated for this small project, but it may be worth it on larger
projects.  There's more in the
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial03/#write-views-that-actually-do-something[Django tutorial].]

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html
====
[source,html]
----
<html>
    <title>To-Do lists</title>
</html>
----
====


Mmmh, syntax-highlighted...much nicer! Now to change our view function:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
====
[source,python]
----
from django.shortcuts import render

def home_page(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html')
----
====

Instead of building our own `HttpResponse`, we now use the Django +render+
function.  It takes the request as its first parameter (for reasons we'll go
into later) and the name of the template to render.  Django will automatically
search folders called 'templates' inside any of your apps' directories.  Then
it builds an `HttpResponse` for you, based on the content of the template.


NOTE: Templates are a very powerful feature of Django's, and their main
    strength consists of substituting Python variables into HTML text. We're
    not using this feature yet, but we will in future chapters.  That's
    why we use `render` and (later) +render_to&#8203;_string+ rather
    than, say, manually reading the file from disk with the built-in `open`.

Let's see if it works:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros,callouts"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test*]
[...]

136, in find_template
    raise TemplateDoesNotExist(name)
django.template.base.TemplateDoesNotExist: home.html<1>

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.004s
----

Another chance to analyse a traceback:

<1> We start with the error: it can't find the template.

<2> Then we double-check what test is failing: sure enough, it's our test
    of the view HTML.

<3> Then we find the line in our tests that caused the failure: it's when
    we call the `home_page` function.

<4> Finally, we look for the part of our own application code that caused the
    failure: it's when we try to call `render`.


So why can't Django find the template?  It's right where it's supposed to be,
in the 'lists/templates' folder.

The thing is that we haven't yet 'officially' registered our lists app with
Django. Unfortunately, just running the `startapp` command and
having what is obviously an app in your project folder isn't quite enough.  You
have to tell Django that you 'really' mean it, and add it to 'settings.py' as
well. Belt and braces. Open it up and look for a variable called
`INSTALLED_APPS`, to which we'll add `lists`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py
====
[source,python]
----
# Application definition

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'lists',
]
----
====

//TODO: the new way of adding it would be lists.apps.ListConfig


You can see there's lots of apps already in there by default.  We just need to
add ours, `lists`, to the bottom of the list.  Don't forget the trailing
comma--it may not be required, but one day you'll be really annoyed when you
forget it and Python concatenates two strings on different lines...

Now we can try running the tests again:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test*]
    [...]
    self.assertTrue(html.endswith('</html>'))
AssertionError: False is not true
----


Darn, not quite.

NOTE: Depending on whether your text editor insists on adding newlines to the
      end of files, you may not even see this error.  If so, you can safely
      ignore the next bit, and skip straight to where you can see the listing
      says OK.


But it did get further!  It seems it managed to find our template, but
the last of the three assertions is failing. Apparently there's something wrong
at the end of the output. I had to do a little +print(repr(html))+
to debug this, but it turns out that the switch to templates has introduced an
additional newline (`\n`) at the end. We can get them to pass like this:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
====
[source,python]
----
self.assertTrue(html.strip().endswith('</html>'))
----
====

It's a tiny bit of a cheat, but whitespace at the end of an HTML file really
shouldn't matter to us. Let's try running the tests again:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py test*
[...]
OK
----

Our refactor of the code is now complete, and the tests mean we're happy that
behaviour is preserved. Now we can change the tests so that they're no longer
testing constants; instead, they should just check that we're rendering the
right template.((("", startref="refactor04")))((("", startref="UTrefactor04")))  

The Django Test Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Django framework", "Test Client", id="DJFtestclient04")))((("Test Client (Django)", id="testclient04")))One
way we could test this is to manually render the template ourselves in the
test, and then compare that to what the view returns.  Django has a function
called [keep-together]#`render_to_string`# which will let us do that:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.lists/tests.py
====
[source,python]
----
from django.template.loader import render_to_string
[...]

    def test_home_page_returns_correct_html(self):
        request = HttpRequest()
        response = home_page(request)
        html = response.content.decode('utf8')
        expected_html = render_to_string('home.html')
        self.assertEqual(html, expected_html)
----
====


But that's a bit of an unwieldy way of testing that we use the right template.
And all this faffing about with `.decode()` and `.strip()` is distracting.
Instead, Django gives us a tool called the
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/testing/tools/#the-test-client[Django
Test Client], which has built-in ways of checking what templates are used.
Here's how it looks:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
====
[source,python]
----
    def test_home_page_returns_correct_html(self):
        response = self.client.get('/')  #<1>

        html = response.content.decode('utf8')  #<2>
        self.assertTrue(html.startswith('<html>'))
        self.assertIn('<title>To-Do lists</title>', html)
        self.assertTrue(html.strip().endswith('</html>'))

        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'home.html')  #<3>
----
====

<1> Instead of manually creating an `HttpRequest` object and calling the view
    function directly, we call `self.client.get`, passing it the URL we want
    to test.

<2> We'll leave the old tests there for now, just to make sure everything is
    working the way we think it is.

<3> `.assertTemplateUsed` is the test method that the Django `TestCase` class
    provides us.  It lets us check what template was used to render a response
    (NB—it will only work for responses that were retrieved by the test
    client).

And that test will still pass:

----
Ran 2 tests in 0.016s

OK
----

Just because I'm always suspicious of a test I haven't seen fail, let's
deliberately break it:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
====
[source,python]
----
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'wrong.html')
----
====

That way we'll also learn what its error messages look like:

----
AssertionError: False is not true : Template 'wrong.html' was not a template
used to render the response. Actual template(s) used: home.html
----

That's very helpful!  Let's change the assert back to the right thing.  While
we're at it, we can delete our old assertions.  And we can also delete the
old +test_root_&#x200b;url_resolves+ test, because that's tested implicitly by the
Django Test Client.  We've combined two long-winded tests into one!

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch04l010)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.test import TestCase

class HomePageTest(TestCase):

    def test_uses_home_template(self):
        response = self.client.get('/')
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'home.html')
----
====


The main point, though, is that instead of testing constants we're testing our
implementation.

.Why Didn't We Just Use the Django Test Client All Along?
*******************************************************************************
You may be asking yourself, "Why didn't we just use the Django Test Client from
the very beginning?"  In real life, that's what I would do.  But I wanted to
show you the "manual" way of doing it first for a couple of reasons.  Firstly
because it allowed me to introduce concepts one by one, and keep the learning
curve as shallow as possible.  Secondly, because you may not always be using
Django to build your apps, and testing tools may not always be available--but
calling functions directly and examining their responses is always possible!

The Django Test Client does also have disadvantages;
<<chapter_purist_unit_tests,later in the book>> we'll discuss the difference
between fully isolated unit tests and the "integrated" tests that the test
client pushes us towards.  But for now, it's very much the pragmatic choice.((("", startref="testclient04")))((("", startref="DJFtestclient04")))
*******************************************************************************


On Refactoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


((("unit tests", "refactoring in")))((("refactoring")))That
was an absolutely trivial example of refactoring. But, as Kent Beck puts
it in <<tddbe,'Test-Driven Development: By Example'>>, "Am I recommending that
you actually work this way? No. I'm recommending that you be 'able' to work
this way".

In fact, as I was writing this my first instinct was to dive in and change the
test first--make it use the `assertTemplateUsed` function straight away;
delete the three superfluous assertions, leaving just a check of the contents
against the expected render; and then go ahead and make the code change.  But
notice how that actually would have left space for me to break things: I could
have defined the template as containing 'any' arbitrary string, instead of
the string with the right `<html>` and `<title>` tags.  

TIP: When refactoring, work on either the code or the tests, but not both at
     once.


There's always a tendency to skip ahead a couple of steps, to make a couple of
tweaks to the behaviour while you're refactoring, but pretty soon you've got
changes to half a dozen different files, you've totally lost track of where you
are, and nothing works any more.  If you don't want to end up like
http://bit.ly/1iXyRt4[Refactoring Cat] (<<RefactoringCat>>), stick to small
steps; keep refactoring and functionality changes entirely separate.

    as an example of what happens when we get carried away and want to change
    too many things at once. Think of it as the little cartoon demon
    counterpart to the Testing Goat, popping up over your other shoulder and
    giving you bad advice...

It's a good idea to do a commit after any refactoring:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status* # see tests.py, views.py, settings.py, + new templates folder
$ *git add .*  # will also add the untracked templates folder
$ *git diff --staged* # review the changes we're about to commit
$ *git commit -m "Refactor home page view to use a template"*
----



A Little More of Our Front Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the meantime, our functional test is still failing.  Let's now make an
actual code change to get it passing.  Because our HTML is now in a template,
we can feel free to make changes to it, without needing to write any extra unit
tests.  We wanted an `<h1>`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html
====
[source,html]
----
<html>
    <head>
        <title>To-Do lists</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Your To-Do list</h1>
    </body>
</html>
----
====

Let's see if our functional test likes it a little better:

----
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: [id="id_new_item"]
----

OK...


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html
====
[source,html]
----
    [...]
        <h1>Your To-Do list</h1>
        <input id="id_new_item" />
    </body>
    [...]
----
====

And now?

----
AssertionError: '' != 'Enter a to-do item'
----

We add our placeholder text...

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html
====
[source,html]
----
    <input id="id_new_item" placeholder="Enter a to-do item" />
----
====

Which gives:

----
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: [id="id_list_table"]
----

So we can go ahead and put the table onto the page. At this stage it'll just be
empty...

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html
====
[source,html]
----
    <input id="id_new_item" placeholder="Enter a to-do item" />
    <table id="id_list_table">
    </table>
</body>
----
====

Now what does the FT say?

----
  File "functional_tests.py", line 43, in
test_can_start_a_list_and_retrieve_it_later
    any(row.text == '1: Buy peacock feathers' for row in rows)
AssertionError: False is not true
----



Slightly cryptic. We can use the line number to track it down, and it turns out
it's that `any` function I was so smug about earlier--or, more precisely, the
`assertTrue`, which doesn't have a very explicit failure message.  We can pass
a custom error message as an argument to most `assertX` methods in `unittest`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests.py
====
[source,python]
----
    self.assertTrue(
        any(row.text == '1: Buy peacock feathers' for row in rows),
        "New to-do item did not appear in table"
    )
----
====

If you run the FT again, you should see our message:

----
AssertionError: False is not true : New to-do item did not appear in table
----


But now, to get this to pass, we will need to actually process the user's
form submission.  And that's a topic for the next chapter.

For now let's do a commit:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff*
$ *git commit -am "Front page HTML now generated from a template"*
----


Thanks to a bit of refactoring, we've got our view set up to render a template,
we've stopped testing constants, and we're now well placed to start processing
user input.


Recap: The TDD Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "overall process of", id="TDDprocess04")))We've
now seen all the main aspects of the TDD process, in practice:

* Functional tests
* Unit tests
* The unit-test/code cycle
* Refactoring

It's time for a little recap, and perhaps even some flowcharts.  Forgive me,
years misspent as a management consultant have ruined me. On the plus side,
it will feature recursion.

What is the overall TDD process? See <<simple-TDD-diagram>>.

We write a test. We run the test and see it fail.  We write some minimal code
to get it a little further.  We rerun the test and repeat until it passes.
Then, optionally, we might refactor our code, using our tests to make sure we
don't break anything.

.Overall TDD process

But how does this apply when we have functional tests 'and' unit tests?  Well,
you can think of the functional test as being a high-level view of the cycle,
where "writing the code" to get the functional tests to pass actually involves
using another, smaller TDD cycle which uses unit tests. See
<<Double-Loop-TDD-diagram>>.

We write a functional test and see it fail.  Then, the process of "writing
code" to get it to pass is a mini-TDD cycle of its own:  we write one or more
unit tests, and go into the unit-test/code cycle until the unit tests pass.
Then, we go back to our FT to check that it gets a little further, and we
can write a bit more of our application--using more unit tests, and so on.

What about refactoring, in the context of functional tests?  Well, that means
we use the functional test to check that we've preserved the behaviour of
our application, but we can change or add and remove unit tests, and use
a unit test cycle to actually change the implementation.

The functional tests are the ultimate judge of whether your application works
or not.  The unit tests are a tool to help you along the way.

This way of looking at things is sometimes called "Double-Loop TDD". One of my
eminent tech reviewers, Emily Bache, wrote http://bit.ly/1iXzoLR[a blog post]
on the topic, which I recommend for a different perspective.

We'll explore all of the different parts of this workflow in more detail
over the coming chapters.((("", startref="TDDprocess04")))
