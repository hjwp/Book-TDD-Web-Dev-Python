Resources
=================
* Figs: Illustrations is still working on the figs.
** 132 total. (There are 76 formal figures, 1 informal one in the front matter, and 55 informal "scratchpad" ones.)

** Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo.
** A report mapping original figure file names to their new names can be found in the tools folder for this project as figure_renaming_report.tsv.

* Intake Report:(Atlas repo) tools/intakereport.txt

* MS Snapshot: To view the submitted files, checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' by running the following command:

$ git checkout manuscript_to_prod

This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag was created. To switch the files back to the current state, run: 

$ git checkout main 

 Notes from Tools:
=================

* PROD: Add any authors to the project that need to be added.

* Syntax highlighting: applied to 534 out of 1201 code listings.

* There are a number files in the repo that aren't in the build list (e.g some additional appendix files, notes files, some code files). Probably many can be deleted but I didn't remove any, in case they anything is pulled in with include statements or otherwise needed.

* I replaced the sidebars with figure markup and copied the PNGs into the repo from the preintake figs folder on /work.

* The acknowledgements are in a separate front matter file rather than in the preface.

* I didn't update the Using Code Examples section of the preface with the latest boilerplate because the existing section has some custom text.

* Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.

Notes at arrival in production:
=================

Some blank IDs and broken xrefs currently in the build log.

KB took screenshots of all the scratchpad images (at least in Chs 1-8 so far), because those are currently created with code and appear like images in the book. We'll need to convert those to informal images, during intake?

This book is finally ready for Intake. We've already started CE and CE review, but the book's main content has been submitted to productionâ€”we were waiting for the author to finish writing all chapter content before starting Intake. The author is making edits to the AI Preface and App A and B in a separate branch, which we will then merge to main. His due date for those are 7/7, but this will probably slip a few days. I'll let you know when we're ready to do this. He knows to avoid the main branch starting today, but let me know if you see any activity there and I'll send a reminder.

There is CSS to keep code blocks from breaking across pages, please retain this for this edition. All CSS should be kept in, if you see something really questionable, let me know.

There are a lot of informal figures, which will have a different numbering system than the captioned ones. Just FYI that these "scratchpad" figures will end up being numbered like 05in01, 05in02, etc. See figure log for details:

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,
Theresa
