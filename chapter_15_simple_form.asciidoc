.A Note for Early Release Readers
****
With Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form—the author's raw and unedited content as they write—so you can take advantage of these technologies long before the official release of these titles.

This will be the 15th chapter of the final book. The GitHub repo is available at https://github.com/hjwp/book-example.

If you have comments about how we might improve the content and/or examples in this book, or if you notice missing material within this chapter, please reach out to the author at obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com.

At the end of the last chapter,
we were left with the thought that there was too much duplication
in the validation handling bits of our views.
Django encourages you to use form classes to do the work of validating user input,
and choosing what error messages to display.
Let's see how that works.

As we go through the chapter,
we'll also spend a bit of time tidying up our unit tests,
and making sure each of them tests only one thing at a time.

// SEBASTIAN: One bigger thing is that I'd put at the beginning
// something to set the expectations and do a little priming of the reader
// - that we're indeed gonna do be doing some refactor
// and in such a case functional tests shield us.

// DAVID: Keeping the test suite passing

// One of the best things I've taken from our recent TDD dojos is the idea of
// keeping the test suite passing during refactors, even to the point of doing
// apparently counter-intuitive things such as copy-pasting code. In this chapter
// we have the test suite failing for quite a while (even to the point where we're
// making git commits while the suite is failing).


=== Moving Validation Logic into a Form

TIP: In Django, a complex view is a code smell.
    Could some of that logic be pushed out to a form?
    Or to some custom methods on the model class?
    Or (perhaps best of all) to a non-Django module that represents your business logic?


((("form data validation", "benefits of")))
((("form data validation", "moving validation logic to forms", id="FDVmoving14")))
((("user interactions", "form data validation", id="UIform14")))
Forms have several superpowers in Django:

* They can process user input and validate it for errors.

* They can be used in templates to render HTML input elements, and error
  messages too.

* And, as we'll see later, some of them can even save data to the database
  for you.

You don't have to use all three form superpowers in every form.  You may prefer
to roll your own HTML, or do your own saving. But they are an excellent place
to keep validation logic.


==== Exploring the Forms API with a Unit Test


((("Forms API", seealso="form data validation")))((("unit tests", "Forms API")))Let's
do a little experimenting with forms by using a unit test.  My plan is to
iterate towards a complete solution, and hopefully introduce forms gradually
enough that they'll make sense if you've never seen them before.

First we add a new file for our form unit tests, and we start with a test that
just looks at the form HTML:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_forms.py (ch15l001)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.test import TestCase

from lists.forms import ItemForm


class ItemFormTest(TestCase):
    def test_form_renders_item_text_input(self):
        form = ItemForm()
        self.fail(form.as_p())
----
====

`form.as_p()` renders the form as HTML.  This unit test uses a `self.fail`
for some exploratory coding.  You could just as easily use a `manage.py shell`
session, although you'd need to keep reloading your code for each change.

Let's make a minimal form.  It inherits from the base `Form` class, and has
a single field called `item_text`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch15l002)
====
[source,python]
----
from django import forms


class ItemForm(forms.Form):
    item_text = forms.CharField()
----
====

We now see a failure message which tells us what the autogenerated form
HTML will look like:

----
AssertionError: <p>
    <label for="id_item_text">Item text:</label>
    <input type="text" name="item_text" required id="id_item_text">
[...]
  </p>
----

It's already pretty close to what we have in _base.html_.  We're missing
the placeholder attribute and the Bootstrap CSS classes.  Let's make our
unit test into a test for that:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_forms.py (ch14l003)
====
[source,python]
----
class ItemFormTest(TestCase):
    def test_form_item_input_has_placeholder_and_css_classes(self):
        form = ItemForm()

        rendered = form.as_p()

        self.assertIn('placeholder="Enter a to-do item"', rendered)
        self.assertIn('class="form-control form-control-lg"', rendered)
----
====


That gives us a fail which justifies some real coding:

[subs="specialcharacters"]
----
    self.assertIn('placeholder="Enter a to-do item"', rendered)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError: 'placeholder="Enter a to-do item"' not found in [...]
----

How can we customise the input for a form field? Using a "widget".
Here it is with just the placeholder:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch15l004)
====
[source,python]
----
class ItemForm(forms.Form):
    item_text = forms.CharField(
        widget=forms.widgets.TextInput(
            attrs={
                "placeholder": "Enter a to-do item",
            }
        ),
    )
----
====

That gives:

----
AssertionError: 'class="form-control form-control-lg"' not found in '<p>\n
<label for="id_item_text">Item text:</label>\n    <input type="text"
name="item_text" placeholder="Enter a to-do item" required id="id_item_text">\n
\n    \n      \n    \n  </p>'
----

And then:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch15l005)
====
[source,python]
----
        widget=forms.widgets.TextInput(
            attrs={
                "placeholder": "Enter a to-do item",
                "class": "form-control form-control-lg",
            }
        ),
----
====

NOTE: Doing this sort of widget customisation would get tedious
    if we had a much larger, more complex form.

    https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.org/[django-crispy-forms]
    for some help.

.Development-Driven Tests: Using Unit Tests for Exploratory Coding
*******************************************************************************

((("unit tests", "using for exploratory coding")))
((("exploratory coding")))
Does this feel a bit like development-driven tests?
That's OK, now and again.

When you're exploring a new API,
you're absolutely allowed to mess about with it for a while
before you get back to rigorous TDD.
You might use the interactive console, or write some exploratory code
(but you have to promise the Testing Goat that you'll throw it away
and rewrite it properly later).

Here we're actually using a unit test as a way of experimenting with the forms API.
It can be a surprisingly good way of learning how something works.


*******************************************************************************

// SEBASTIAN: Small suggestion - I'd appreciate mentioning breakpoint() for use in test
//      to be able to play with a form instance even more


==== Switching to a Django ModelForm

((("ModelForm class")))
What's next?
We want our form to reuse the validation code that we've already defined on our model.
Django provides a special class that can autogenerate a form for a model, called `ModelForm`.
As you'll see, it's configured using a special inner class called `Meta`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch15l006)
====
[source,python]
----
from django import forms

from lists.models import Item


class ItemForm(forms.models.ModelForm):
    class Meta:  # <1>
        model = Item
        fields = ("text",)

    # item_text = forms.CharField(  #<2>
    #     widget=forms.widgets.TextInput(
    #         attrs={
    #             "placeholder": "Enter a to-do item",
    #             "class": "form-control form-control-lg",
    #         }
    #     ),
    # )
----
====

<1> In `Meta` we specify which model the form is for,
    and which fields we want it to use.

<2> We'll comment out our manually-created field for now.


++ModelForm++s do all sorts of smart stuff,
like assigning sensible HTML form input types to different types of field,
and applying default validation.
Check out the
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/forms/modelforms/[docs]
for more info.

We now have some different-looking form HTML:

----
AssertionError: 'placeholder="Enter a to-do item"' not found in '<p>\n
<label for="id_text">Text:</label>\n    <textarea name="text" cols="40"
rows="10" required id="id_text">\n</textarea>\n    \n    \n      \n    \n
</p>'
----


It's lost our placeholder and CSS class.
And you can also see that it's using
`name="text"` instead of `name="item_text"`.
We can probably live with that.
But it's using a `textarea` instead of a normal input,
and that's not the UI we want for our app.
Thankfully, you can override widgets for `ModelForm` fields,
similarly to the way we did it with the normal form:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch15l007)
====
[source,python]
----
class ItemForm(forms.models.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Item
        fields = ("text",)
        widgets = {  # <1>
            "text": forms.widgets.TextInput(
                attrs={
                    "placeholder": "Enter a to-do item",
                    "class": "form-control form-control-lg",
                }
            ),
        }
----
====

<1> We restore some of our commented-out code here,
    but modified slightly, from being an attribute declaration,
    to a key in a dict.

That gets the test passing.


==== Testing and Customising Form Validation

Now let's see if the `ModelForm` has picked up the same validation rules
which we defined on the model.
We'll also learn how to pass data into the form, as if it came from the user:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_forms.py (ch15l008)
====
[source,python]
----
    def test_form_item_input_has_placeholder_and_css_classes(self):
        [...]

    def test_form_validation_for_blank_items(self):
        form = ItemForm(data={"text": ""})
        form.save()
----
====

That gives us:

----
ValueError: The Item could not be created because the data didn't validate.
----

Good: the form won't allow you to save if you give it an empty item text.

Now let's see if we can get it to use the specific error message that we
want.  The API for checking form validation 'before' we try to save any
data is a function called `is_valid`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_forms.py (ch15l009)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_form_item_input_has_placeholder_and_css_classes(self):
    [...]

def test_form_validation_for_blank_items(self):
    [...]

def test_form_validation_for_blank_items(self):
    form = ItemForm(data={"text": ""})
    self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
    self.assertEqual(form.errors["text"], ["You can't have an empty list item"])
----
====

Calling `form.is_valid()` returns `True` or `False`,
but it also has the side effect of validating the input data,
and populating the `errors` attribute.
It's a dictionary mapping the names of fields to lists of errors for those fields
(it's possible for a field to have more than one error).

That gives us:

----
AssertionError: ['This field is required.'] != ["You can't have an empty list
item"]
----

Django already has a default error message
that we could present to the user--you might use it
if you were in a hurry to build your web app,
but we care enough to make our message special.
Customising it means changing `error_messages`, another `Meta` variable:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch15l010)
====
[source,python]
----
    class Meta:
        model = Item
        fields = ("text",)
        widgets = {
            "text": forms.widgets.TextInput(
                attrs={
                    "placeholder": "Enter a to-do item",
                    "class": "form-control form-control-lg",
                }
            ),
        }
        error_messages = {"text": {"required": "You can't have an empty list item"}}
----
====

----
OK
----

You know what would be even better than messing about with all these error strings?
Having a constant:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch15l011)
====
[source,python]
----
EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR = "You can't have an empty list item"
[...]
        error_messages = {"text": {"required": EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR}}
----
====

Rerun the tests to see that they pass...OK.
Now we can change the tests too.

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_forms.py (ch15l012)
====
[source,python]
----
from lists.forms import EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR, ItemForm
[...]

    def test_form_validation_for_blank_items(self):
        form = ItemForm(data={"text": ""})
        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
        self.assertEqual(form.errors["text"], [EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR])
----
====

TIP: This is a good example of re-using constants in tests.
    It makes it easier to change the error message later.


And the tests still pass:


----
OK
----

((("", startref="FDVmoving14")))Great.  Totes committable:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status* # should show forms.py and test_forms.py
$ *git add src/lists*
$ *git commit -m "new form for list items"*
----


=== Using the Form in Our Views

((("form data validation", "using forms in views", id="FDVviews14")))
At this point we may be tempted to carry on,
perhaps extend the form to capture uniqueness validation
as well as empty-item validation.

But there's a sort of corollary to the "deploy as early as possible" lean methodology,
which is "merge code as early as possible".
In other words: while building this bit of forms code,
it would be easy to go on for ages,
adding more and more functionality to the form--I should know,
because that's exactly what I did during the drafting of this chapter,
and I ended up doing all sorts of work
making an all-singing, all-dancing form class
before I realised it wouldn't _actually_ work for our most basic use case.

So, instead, try to use your new bit of code as soon as possible.
This makes sure you never have unused bits of code lying around,
and that you start checking your code against "the real world" as soon as possible.

We have a form class that can render some HTML
and do validation of at least one kind of error--let's start using it!
We should be able to use it in our _base.html_ template,
and so in all of our views.


==== Using the Form in a View with a GET Request


((("GET requests")))
((("HTML", "GET requests")))
Let's start with our unit tests for the home view.
We'll add a new method that checks whether we're using the right kind of form:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_views.py (ch11l013)
====
[source,python]
----
from lists.forms import ItemForm
[...]

class HomePageTest(TestCase):
    def test_uses_home_template(self):
        [...]

    def test_home_page_uses_item_form(self):
        response = self.client.get("/")
        self.assertIsInstance(response.context["form"], ItemForm)  #<1>
----
====

<1> `assertIsInstance` checks that our form is of the correct class.

// TODO: consider checking for html instead?


That gives us:

----
KeyError: 'form'
----


So we use the form in our home page view:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/views.py (ch11l014)
====
[source,python]
----
[...]
from lists.forms import ItemForm
from lists.models import Item, List


def home_page(request):
    return render(request, "home.html", {"form": ItemForm()})
----
====

OK, now let's try using it in the template--we
replace the old `<input ..>` with `{{ form.text }}`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/templates/base.html (ch11l015)
====
[source,html]
----
  <form method="POST" action="{% block form_action %}{% endblock %}" >
    {{ form.text }}  <1>
    {% csrf_token %}
    {% if error %}
      <div class="invalid-feedback">{{ error }}</div>
    {% endif %}
  </form>
----
====

<1> `{{ form.text }}` renders just the HTML input for the `text` field of the form.


And we're back to passing unit tests:

----
Ran 18 tests in 0.019s

OK
----



==== A Big Find and Replace

((("find and replace")))
((("grep command")))
One thing we have done, though, is change our form--it
no longer uses the same `id` and `name` attributes.
You'll see if we run our functional tests,
they fail the first time they try to find the input box:

----
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: [id="id_new_item"]; [...]
[...]
Ran 4 tests in 6.524s

FAILED (errors=4)
----

We'll need to fix this, and it's going to involve a big find and replace.
Before we do that, let's do a commit,
to keep the rename separate from the logic change:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff* # review changes in base.html, views.py and its tests
$ *git commit -am "WIP - use new form in home_page. NB breaks stuff"*
----


Let's fix the functional tests.
A quick `grep` shows us there are several places where we're using `id_new_item`:

[subs=""]
----
$ <strong>grep id_new_item src/functional_tests/test*</strong>
src/functional_tests/test_layout_and_styling.py:        inputbox =
self.browser.find_element(By.ID, "id_new_item")
src/functional_tests/test_layout_and_styling.py:        inputbox =
self.browser.find_element(By.ID, "id_new_item")
src/functional_tests/test_list_item_validation.py:
self.browser.find_element(By.ID, "id_new_item").send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
[...]
----

That's a good call for a refactor within the FTs.
Let's make a new helper method in _base.py_:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/functional_tests/base.py (ch11l018)
====
[source,python]
----
class FunctionalTest(StaticLiveServerTestCase):
    [...]
    def get_item_input_box(self):
        return self.browser.find_element(By.ID, "id_text")
----
====

And then we use it throughout--I had to make four changes in
_test_simple_list_creation.py_, two in _test_layout_and_styling.py_, and six
in _test_list_item_validation.py_, for example:


[role="sourcecode dofirst-ch11l020 currentcontents"]
.src/functional_tests/test_simple_list_creation.py
====
[source,python]
----
    # She is invited to enter a to-do item straight away
    inputbox = self.get_item_input_box()
----
====

Or:

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.src/functional_tests/test_list_item_validation.py
====
[source,python]
----
    # an empty list item. She hits Enter on the empty input box
    self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
----
====

I won't show you every single one; I'm sure you can manage this for yourself!
You can redo the `grep` to check that you've caught them all.

We've done the FT side of the rename.
If you run them you'll see a change,
the FTS are no longer falling over trying to find `id_new_item`,
instead they can't find `id_list_table`.
Interspersed, you'll an exception bubbling up from our views code,
`KeyError: 'item_text'`, pointing us towards where we now need to make the fix
on the application side:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]
    item = Item(text=request.POST["item_text"], list=nulist)
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    [...]
django.utils.datastructures.MultiValueDictKeyError: 'item_text'
[...]

selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: [id="id_list_table"]; [...]
[...]

Ran 4 tests in 35.495s

FAILED (errors=4)
----

So we're done on the FT side,
but now we have to bring the rest of the application code in line with the change.
Let's look through our application code for any references to the old
`id` attribute, `id_new_item`; we'll need to replace them with `id_text`,
just like we did in the FTs.
On top of that, we'll also need to look for any occurences of the old `name`
attribute, `item_text`, and replace them with just `text`.


[role="ignore-errors"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *grep -r id_new_item src/lists/*
----

Good, there are no references to `id_new_item` left--except maybe in some
`.pyc` files, which are safe to ignore.

What about `name`/ `item_text`?

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*grep -Ir item_text src/lists*]
src/lists/views.py:    item = Item(text=request.POST["item_text"], list=nulist)
src/lists/views.py:            item = Item(text=request.POST["item_text"],
list=our_list)
src/lists/migrations/0003_list.py:        ("lists", "0002_item_text"),
src/lists/tests/test_views.py:        response = self.client.post("/lists/new",
data={"item_text": ""})
src/lists/tests/test_views.py:        self.client.post("/lists/new",
[...]
src/lists/tests/test_views.py:            data={"item_text": ""},
----

We can ignore the migration which is just using `item_text` as metadata.
So the changes we need to make are all in _views.py_ and _test_views.py_.
Let's go ahead and make those.
I'm sure you can manage your own find and replace!
They should look something like this:

==== Ensuring errors are displayed

Our problems affect both the existing list items view, `view_list()`,
and the view that handles creating brand new lists from the home page,
`new_list()`.

Let's start with the latter, since it comes first logically,
and it will make sure that we know how to use our new form from end to end.

Looking into _views.py_ and the `new_list()` view we can see
that we're not using our new form at all:

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.src/lists/views.py
====
[source,python]
----
def new_list(request):
    nulist = List.objects.create()
    item = Item(text=request.POST["text"], list=nulist)
    try:
        item.full_clean()
        item.save()
    except ValidationError:
        nulist.delete()
        error = "You can't have an empty list item"
        return render(request, "home.html", {"error": error})  # <1>
    return redirect(nulist)
----
====

((("", startref="FDVviews14")))


=== Using the Form in a View That Takes POST Requests

((("form data validation", "processing POST requests", id="FDVpost14")))
How shall we evolve our view so that it uses a form instead of
the manual manipulation of `request.POST` and the error message.

So we want to adjust the unit tests for the `new_list()` view,
especially the one that deals with validation.
Let's take a look at it now:

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.src/lists/tests/test_views.py
====
[source,python]
----
class NewListTest(TestCase):
    [...]

    def test_validation_errors_are_sent_back_to_home_page_template(self):
        response = self.client.post("/lists/new", data={"text": ""})
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "home.html")
        expected_error = html.escape("You can't have an empty list item")
        self.assertContains(response, expected_error)
----
====


Let's add a check that we send our form to the template.
While we're at it, we'll use our constant
instead of the hardcoded string for that error message:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_views.py (ch14l023)
====
[source,python]
----
from lists.forms import EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR, ItemForm
[...]

class NewListTest(TestCase):
    [...]

    def test_validation_errors_are_sent_back_to_home_page_template(self):
        response = self.client.post("/lists/new", data={"text": ""})
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "home.html")
        self.assertIsInstance(response.context["form"], ItemForm)
        self.assertContains(response, html.escape(EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR))
----
====

We get an expected failure:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test lists*]
[...]
    self.assertIsInstance(response.context["form"], ItemForm)
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^
[...]
KeyError: 'form'
----


And here's how we use the form in the view:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/views.py (ch14l024)
====
[source,python]
----
def new_list(request):
    form = ItemForm(data=request.POST)  #<1>
    if form.is_valid():  #<2>
        nulist = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(text=request.POST["text"], list=nulist)
        return redirect(nulist)
    else:
        return render(request, "home.html", {"form": form})  #<3>
----
====

<1> We pass the `request.POST` data into the form's constructor.

<2> We use `form.is_valid()` to determine whether this is a good
    or a bad submission.

<3> In the invalid case, we pass the form down to the template,
    instead of our hardcoded error string.

That view is now looking much nicer!

But, we have a regression in the unit tests:

----
    self.assertContains(response, html.escape(EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR))
[...]
AssertionError: False is not true : Couldn't find 'You can&#x27;t have an empty
list item' in the following response
----


==== Using the Form to Display Errors in the Template

We're failing because we're not yet _using_ the form
to display errors in the template.
Here's how to do that:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/templates/base.html (ch14l026)
====
[source,html]
----
  <form method="POST" action="{% block form_action %}{% endblock %}" >
    {{ form.text }}
    {% csrf_token %}
    {% if form.errors %}  <1>
      <div class="invalid-feedback">{{ form.errors.text }}</div>  <2>
    {% endif %}
  </form>
----
====

<1> We change the `if` to look at `form.errors`:
    it contains a list of all the errors for the form.

<2> `form.errors.text` is magical Django template syntax
    for `form.errors["text"]`,
    i.e., the list of errors for the text field in particular.

What does that do to our unit tests?

----
======================================================================
FAIL: test_validation_errors_end_up_on_lists_page (lists.tests.test_views.ListV
iewTest.test_validation_errors_end_up_on_lists_page)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]
AssertionError: False is not true : Couldn't find 'You can&#x27;t have an empty
list item' in the following response
----

An unexpected failure--it's actually in the tests for our final view, `view_list`.
Because we've changed the way errors are displayed in _all_ templates,
we're no longer showing the error that we manually pass into the template.

That means we're going to need to rework existing list view, `view_list()`, as well,
before we can get back to a working state.
((("", startref="FDVpost14")))


=== Using the Form in the Existing Lists View

((("form data validation", "processing POST and GET requests", id="FDVproget14")))
This list view handles both GET and POST requests.  As a reminder:

* A normal GET renders a template containing both the list and the form to add a new item.
* A valid POST request should have its form contents processed, and return a redirect
* An invalid POST request should re-render the template with the list, and the form with errors in.

(See <<single-endpoint-for-forms>> in the previous chapter if a diagram would be helpful).
We're doing this stuff "manually" for now, and we want to switch to using our form.

Let's start by checking that the form is used in GET requests.
We can have a new test for that:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_views.py (ch14l027)
====
[source,python]
----
class ListViewTest(TestCase):
    [...]

    def test_displays_item_form(self):
        mylist = List.objects.create()
        response = self.client.get(f"/lists/{mylist.id}/")
        self.assertIsInstance(response.context["form"], ItemForm)
        self.assertContains(response, 'name="text"')
----
====

That gives:

----
KeyError: 'form'
----

Here's a minimal implementation. We initialise our `ItemForm()` at the end of the view,
and change the `render()` call so it passes `"form"` to the template,
_as well as_ the list of errors.  Yes, later we'll get the errors form the form too!
But we want to move one step at a time, working state to working state.

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/views.py (ch14l028)
====
[source,python]
----
def view_list(request, list_id):
    [...]
    form = ItemForm()
    return render(
        request,
        "list.html",
        {"list": our_list, "form": form, "error": error},
    )
----
====


==== A Helper Method for Several Short Tests

((("helper methods")))
So now we want to use the form errors in the existing lists view.

For clarity, let's split our current single test for the invalid case
(`test_validation_errors_end_up_on_lists_page()`)
into several separate ones:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_views.py (ch14l030)
====
[source,python]
----
class ListViewTest(TestCase):
    [...]

    def post_invalid_input(self):
        mylist = List.objects.create()
        return self.client.post(
            f"/lists/{mylist.id}/",
            data={"text": ""},
        )

    def test_for_invalid_input_nothing_saved_to_db(self):
        self.post_invalid_input()
        self.assertEqual(Item.objects.count(), 0)

    def test_for_invalid_input_renders_list_template(self):
        response = self.post_invalid_input()
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "list.html")

    def test_for_invalid_input_passes_form_to_template(self):
        response = self.post_invalid_input()
        self.assertIsInstance(response.context["form"], ItemForm)

    def test_for_invalid_input_shows_error_on_page(self):
        response = self.post_invalid_input()
        self.assertContains(response, html.escape(EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR))
----
====

By making a little helper function, `post_invalid_input()`,
we can make four separate tests without duplicating lots of lines of code.

We've seen this several times now.
It often feels more natural to write view tests as a single,
monolithic block of assertions--the view should do this and this and this,
then return that with this.
But breaking things out into multiple tests is often worthwhile;
as we saw in previous chapters,
it helps you isolate the exact problem you have
when you later accidentally introduce a bug.
Helper methods are one of the tools that lower the psychological barrier,
by reducing boilerplate and keeping the tests readable.

// TODO - maybe a little aside saying i'm exaggerating here?
// not sure i would do this IRL.
// i mean, it's a good idea _in general_,
// just maybe not for forms???

For example, now we can see there's just one failure, and it's a clear one:


----
======================================================================
FAIL: test_for_invalid_input_shows_error_on_page (lists.tests.test_views.ListVi
ewTest.test_for_invalid_input_shows_error_on_page)

AssertionError: False is not true : Couldn't find 'You can&#x27;t have an empty
list item' in the following response
[...]

Ran 22 tests in 0.021s

FAILED (failures=1)
----

Now let's see if we can properly rewrite the view to use our form.
Here's a good stab at it:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/views.py (ch14l031)
====
[source,python]
----
def view_list(request, list_id):
    our_list = List.objects.get(id=list_id)
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = ItemForm(data=request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            Item.objects.create(text=request.POST["text"], list=our_list)
            return redirect(our_list)
    else:
        form = ItemForm()
    return render(request, "list.html", {"list": our_list, "form": form})
----
====

That gets the unit tests passing:

----
Ran 22 tests in 0.086s

OK
----


Phew! How about the FTs?

What about this last remaining problem?


[role="pagebreak-before"]
=== An Unexpected Benefit: Free Client-Side Validation from HTML5

((("HTML5")))
How shall we find out what's going on here?
One option is to add the usual `time.sleep` just before the error in the FTs,
and take a look at what's happening while they run.
Alternatively, spin up the site manually with `manage.py runserver` if you prefer.
Either way, you should see something like <<html5_popup_screenshot>>.


[[html5_popup_screenshot]]
.HTML5 validation says no
image::images/html5-validation-popup.png["The input with a popup saying 'please fill out this field'"]

It seems like the browser is preventing the user
from even submitting the input when it's empty.

It's because Django has added the `required` attribute to the HTML input
(take another look at our `as_p()` printouts from earlier if you don't believe me,
or have a look at the source in Dev tools).
This is a
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#attr-required[feature of HTML5];
browsers nowadays will do some validation at the client side if they can,
preventing users from even submitting invalid input.
That's actually good news!

But, we were working based on incorrect assumptions
about what the user experience was going to be.
Let's change our FT to reflect this new expectation.

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.src/functional_tests/test_list_item_validation.py (ch14l032)
====
[source,python]
----
class ItemValidationTest(FunctionalTest):
    def test_cannot_add_empty_list_items(self):
        # Edith goes to the home page and accidentally tries to submit
        # an empty list item. She hits Enter on the empty input box
        self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
        self.get_item_input_box().send_keys(Keys.ENTER)

        # The browser intercepts the request, and does not load the list page
        self.wait_for(
            lambda: self.browser.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "#id_text:invalid")  #<1>
        )

        # She starts typing some text for the new item and the error disappears
        self.get_item_input_box().send_keys("Purchase milk")
        self.wait_for(
            lambda: self.browser.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "#id_text:valid")  #<2>
        )

        # And she can submit it successfully
        self.get_item_input_box().send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
        self.wait_for_row_in_list_table("1: Purchase milk")

        # Perversely, she now decides to submit a second blank list item
        self.get_item_input_box().send_keys(Keys.ENTER)

        # Again, the browser will not comply
        self.wait_for_row_in_list_table("1: Purchase milk")
        self.wait_for(
            lambda: self.browser.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "#id_text:invalid")
        )

        # And she can make it happy by filling some text in
        self.get_item_input_box().send_keys("Make tea")
        self.wait_for(
            lambda: self.browser.find_element(
                By.CSS_SELECTOR,
                "#id_text:valid",
            )
        )
        self.get_item_input_box().send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
        self.wait_for_row_in_list_table("2: Make tea")
----
====

<1> Instead of checking for our custom error message,
    we check using the CSS pseudoselector `:invalid`,
    which the browser applies to any HTML5 input that has invalid input.

<2> And its converse in the case of valid inputs.

See how useful and flexible our `self.wait_for()` function is turning out to be?
((("", startref="FDVproget14")))

Our FT does look quite different from how it started though, doesn't it?
I'm sure that's raising a lot of questions in your mind right now.
Put a pin in them for a moment;
I promise we'll talk. Let's first see if we're back to passing tests:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]
Ran 4 tests in 12.154s

OK
----



=== A Pat on the Back

First let's give ourselves a massive pat on the back:
we've just made a major change to our small app--that input field,
with its name and ID, is absolutely critical to making everything work.
We've touched seven or eight different files,
doing a refactor that's quite involved...this
is the kind of thing that, without tests, would seriously worry me.
In fact, I might well have decided
that it wasn't worth messing with code that works.
But, because we have a full test suite, we can delve around,
tidying things up, safe in the knowledge
that the tests are there to spot any mistakes we make.
It just makes it that much likelier that you're going to keep refactoring,
keep tidying up, keep gardening, keep tending your code,
keep everything neat and tidy and clean and smooth
and precise and concise and functional and good.

Finally, we can mark the last item on our to-do list from the last chapter as
done:

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Remove duplication of validation logic in
  views#'
*****

And it's definitely time for a commit:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff*
$ *git commit -am "use form in all views, back to working state"*
----

[role="pagebreak-before less_space"]
==== But Have We Wasted a Lot of Time?


((("form data validation", "benefits of")))
But what about our custom error message?
What about all that effort rendering the form in our HTML template?
We're not even passing those errors from Django to the user
if the browser is intercepting the requests before the user even makes them?
And our FT isn't even testing that stuff any more!

Well, you're quite right.
But there are two or three reasons all our time hasn't been wasted.
Firstly, client-side validation isn't enough
to guarantee you're protected from bad inputs,
so you always need the server side as well
if you really care about data integrity;
using a form is a nice way of encapsulating that logic.

((("HTML5")))
Also, not all browsers fully implement HTML5,footnote:[
Safari was a notable laggard in the last decade,
it's up to date now]
so some users might still see our custom error message.
And if or when we come to letting users access our data via an API
(see <<appendix_rest_api>>),
then our validation messages will come back into use.

On top of that, we'll be able to reuse all our validation and forms code
and the front-end `.has-error` classes in the next chapter,
when we do some more advanced validation that can't be done by HTML5 magic.

But you know, even if all that wasn't true, you still can't beat yourself up
for occasionally going down a blind alley while you're coding.
None of us can see the future,
and we should concentrate on finding the right solution
rather than the time "wasted" on the wrong solution.

==== Using the Form's Own Save Method


((("form data validation", "using form&#x2019;s own save method", id="FDVsave14")))
There are a couple more things we can do to make our views even simpler.
I've mentioned that forms are supposed to be able to save data
to the database for us.
Our case won't quite work out of the box,
because the item needs to know what list to save to,
but it's not hard to fix that.

We start, as always, with a test.
Just to illustrate what the problem is,
let's see what happens if we just try to call `form.save()`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_forms.py (ch11l033)
====
[source,python]
----
    def test_form_save_handles_saving_to_a_list(self):
        form = ItemForm(data={"text": "do me"})
        new_item = form.save()
----
====

Django isn't happy, because an item needs to belong to a list:

----
django.db.utils.IntegrityError: NOT NULL constraint failed: lists_item.list_id
----

Our solution is to tell the form's save method what list it should save to.

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_forms.py (ch14l034)
====
[source,python]
----
from lists.models import Item, List
[...]

    def test_form_save_handles_saving_to_a_list(self):
        mylist = List.objects.create()
        form = ItemForm(data={"text": "do me"})
        new_item = form.save(for_list=mylist)  # <1>
        self.assertEqual(new_item, Item.objects.get())  #<2>
        self.assertEqual(new_item.text, "do me")
        self.assertEqual(new_item.list, mylist)
----
====

<1> We'll imagine that the `.save()` method takes a `for_list=` argument.
<2> We then make sure that the item is correctly saved to the database,
with the right attributes.

The tests fail as expected, because as usual, it's still only wishful thinking:

----
    new_item = form.save(for_list=mylist)
TypeError: BaseModelForm.save() got an unexpected keyword argument 'for_list'
----

Here's how we can implement a custom save method:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch14l035)
====
[source,python]
----
class ItemForm(forms.models.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        [...]

    def save(self, for_list):
        self.instance.list = for_list
        return super().save()
----
====

The `.instance` attribute on a form represents the database object
that is being modified or created.
And I only learned that as I was writing this chapter!
There are other ways of getting this to work,
including manually creating the object yourself,
or using the `commit=False` argument to save,
but this way seemed neatest.
We'll explore a different way of making a form "know" what list it's for
in the next chapter.

----
Ran 23 tests in 0.086s
OK
----

Finally, we can refactor our views. `new_list()` first:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/views.py (ch14l036)
====
[source,python]
----
def new_list(request):
    form = ItemForm(data=request.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
        nulist = List.objects.create()
        form.save(for_list=nulist)
        return redirect(nulist)
    else:
        return render(request, "home.html", {"form": form})
----
====

Rerun the test to check that everything still passes:

----
Ran 23 tests in 0.086s
OK
----


Then, refactor `view_list()`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/views.py (ch14l037)
====
[source,python]
----
def view_list(request, list_id):
    our_list = List.objects.get(id=list_id)
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = ItemForm(data=request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save(for_list=our_list)
            return redirect(our_list)
    else:
        form = ItemForm()
    return render(request, "list.html", {"list": our_list, "form": form})
----
====

We still have full passes:

// remove unused imports

----
Ran 23 tests in 0.111s

and:


----

OK

Great!  Let's commit our changes:
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git commit -am "implement custom save method for the form"*
----

Our two views are now looking very much like "normal" Django views:
they take information from a user's request,
combine it with some custom logic or information from the URL (`list_id`),
pass it to a form for validation and possible saving,
and then redirect or render a template.

Forms and validation are really important in Django,
and in web programming in general,
so let's try to make a slightly more complicated one in the next chapter, to
learn how to prevent duplicate items.

.Tips
*******************************************************************************
Thin views::
    If you find yourself looking at complex views, and having to write a lot of
    tests for them, it's time to start thinking about whether that logic could
    be moved elsewhere: possibly to a form, like we've done here.
    +++<br />+++
    Another possible place would be a custom method on the model class.
    And--once the complexity of the app demands it--out of Django-specific
    files and into your own classes and functions, that capture your core
    business logic.
    ((("form data validation", "best practices")))
    ((("thin views vs. complex views")))
    ((("complex views vs. thin views")))


Each test should test one thing::
    The heuristic is to be suspicious if there's more than one assertion
    in a unit test.
    Sometimes two assertions are closely related, so they belong together.
    But often your first draft of a test ends up testing multiple behaviours,
    and it's worth rewriting it as several tests,
    so that each one can pinpoint specific problems more precisely,
    and one failure doesn't mask another.
    Helper functions can keep them your tests getting too bloated.
