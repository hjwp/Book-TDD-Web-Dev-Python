Finishing "My Lists": Outside-In TDD
------------------------------------

.Warning, Chapter Not Updated
*******************************************************************************
🚧 Warning, this Chapter is the 2e version, and uses Django 1.11

This chapter and all the following ones are the second edition versions, so they still use Django 1.11, Python 3.8, and so on.

To follow along with this chapter, it’s probably easiest to reset your code to match my example code as it was in the 2e, by resetting to: https://github.com/hjwp/book-example/tree/chapter_20_fixtures_and_wait_decorator

And you should also probably delete and re-create your virtualenv with
* Python 3.8 or 3.9
* and Django 1.11 (pip install "django <2")

Alternatively, you can muddle through
and try and figure out how to make things work with Django 4 etc,
but be aware that the listings below won’t be quite right.
All the fabric stuff needs to be migrated to ansible, for a start.

((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "outside-in technique", id="TTDoutside22")))In
this chapter I'd like to talk about a technique called Outside-In TDD.
It's pretty much what we've been doing all along. Our "double-loop" TDD
process, in which we write the functional test first and then the unit tests,
is already a manifestation of outside-in--we design the system from the
outside, and build up our code in layers. Now I'll make it explicit, and talk
about some of the common issues involved. 


The Alternative: "Inside-Out"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The alternative to "outside-in" is to work "inside-out", which is the way most
people intuitively work before they encounter TDD. After
coming up with a design, the natural inclination is sometimes to implement it
starting with the innermost, lowest-level components first.

For example, when faced with our current problem, providing users with a
"My Lists" page of saved lists, the temptation is to start by adding an "owner"
attribute to the `List` model object, reasoning that an attribute like this is
"obviously" going to be required. Once that's in place, we would modify the
more peripheral layers of code, such as views and templates, taking advantage
of the new attribute, and then finally add URL routing to point to the new
view.

It feels comfortable because it means you're never working on a bit of code
that is dependent on something that hasn't yet been implemented. Each bit of
work on the inside is a solid foundation on which to build the next layer out.

But working inside-out like this also has some weaknesses.

Why Prefer "Outside-In"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


((("Outside-In TDD", "vs. inside-out", secondary-sortas="inside-out")))((("inside-out TDD")))The
most obvious problem with inside-out is that it requires us to stray from a
TDD workflow. Our functional test's first failure might be due to missing URL
routing, but we decide to ignore that and go off adding attributes to our
database model objects instead.

We might have ideas in our head about the new desired behaviour of our inner
layers like database models, and often these ideas will be pretty good, but
they are actually just speculation about what's really required, because
we haven't yet built the outer layers that will use them.

One problem that can result is to build inner components that are more
general or more capable than we actually need, which is a waste of time,
and an added source of complexity for your project. Another common problem
is that you create inner components with an API which is convenient for their
own internal design, but which later turns out to be inappropriate for the
calls your outer layers would like to make...worse still, you might end up
with inner components which, you later realise, don't actually solve the
problem that your outer layers need solved.

In contrast, working outside-in allows you to use each layer to imagine the
most convenient API you could want from the layer beneath it. Let's see it in 
action.


The FT for "My Lists"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("functional tests (FTs)", "outside-in technique")))As
we work through the following functional test, we start with the most
outward-facing (presentation layer), through to the view functions (or
"controllers"), and lastly the innermost layers, which in this case will be
model code.

We know our `create_pre_authenticated_session` code works now, so we can just
write our FT to look for a "My Lists" page:


[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/test_my_lists.py (ch19l001-1)
====
[source,python]
----
    def test_logged_in_users_lists_are_saved_as_my_lists(self):
        # Edith is a logged-in user
        self.create_pre_authenticated_session('edith@example.com')

        # She goes to the home page and starts a list
        self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
        self.add_list_item('Reticulate splines')
        self.add_list_item('Immanentize eschaton')
        first_list_url = self.browser.current_url

        # She notices a "My lists" link, for the first time.
        self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('My lists').click()

        # She sees that her list is in there, named according to its
        # first list item
        self.wait_for(
            lambda: self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('Reticulate splines')
        )
        self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('Reticulate splines').click()
        self.wait_for(
            lambda: self.assertEqual(self.browser.current_url, first_list_url)
        )
----
====


//TODO: add a check for email in my lists page header, reflow logic
// to fit better with workshops..

We create a list with a couple of items, and then we check that this list
appears on a new "My Lists" page, and that it's "named" after the first item
in the list.

Let's validate that it really works by creating a second list, and seeing that
appear on the My Lists page as well.  The FT continues, and while we're at it,
we check that only logged-in users can see the "My Lists" page:
        
[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/test_my_lists.py (ch19l001-2)
====
[source,python]
----
        [...]
        self.wait_for(
            lambda: self.assertEqual(self.browser.current_url, first_list_url)
        )
        
        # She decides to start another list, just to see
        self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
        self.add_list_item('Click cows')
        second_list_url = self.browser.current_url

        # Under "my lists", her new list appears
        self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('My lists').click()
        self.wait_for(
            lambda: self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('Click cows')
        )
        self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('Click cows').click()
        self.wait_for(
            lambda: self.assertEqual(self.browser.current_url, second_list_url)
        )

        # She logs out.  The "My lists" option disappears
        self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('Log out').click()
        self.wait_for(lambda: self.assertEqual(
            self.browser.find_elements_by_link_text('My lists'),
            []
        ))
----
====

Our FT uses a new helper method, `add_list_item`, which abstracts away entering
text into the right input box.  We define it in 'base.py':


[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.functional_tests/base.py (ch19l001-3)
====
[source,python]
----
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
[...]

    def add_list_item(self, item_text):
        num_rows = len(self.browser.find_elements_by_css_selector('#id_list_table tr'))
        self.get_item_input_box().send_keys(item_text)
        self.get_item_input_box().send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
        item_number = num_rows + 1
        self.wait_for_row_in_list_table(f'{item_number}: {item_text}')
----
====


And while we're at it we can use it in a few of the other FTs, like this:


[role="sourcecode currentcontents dofirst-ch19l001-4"]
.functional_tests/test_list_item_validation.py
====
[source,python]
----
    self.add_list_item('Buy wellies')
----
====

I think it makes the FTs a lot more readable. I made a total of six
changes--see if you agree with me.

A quick run of all FTs, a commit, and then back to the FT we're working on.
The first error should look like this:

//IDEA: add a thing that looks for her email address in an h1?

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests.test_my_lists*]
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: My lists
----


The Outside Layer: Presentation and Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


((("Outside-In TDD", "outside layer")))The
test is currently failing saying that it can't find a link saying "My
Lists". We can address that at the presentation layer, in 'base.html', in
our navigation bar. Here's the minimal code change:


[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch19l002-1)
====
[source,html]
----
  {% if user.email %}
    <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-left">
      <li><a href="#">My lists</a></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
      <li class="navbar-text">Logged in as {{ user.email }}</li>
      <li><a href="{% url 'logout' %}">Log out</a></li>
    </ul>
----
====

Of course, that link doesn't actually go anywhere, but it does get us along to
the next failure:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests.test_my_lists*]
[...]
    lambda: self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('Reticulate splines')
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: Reticulate splines
----

Which is telling us we're going to have to build a page that lists all of a
user's lists by title.  Let's start with the basics--a URL and a placeholder
template for it.

Again, we can go outside-in, starting at the presentation layer with just the 
URL and nothing else:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch19l002-2)
====
[source,html]
----
    <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-left">
      <li><a href="{% url 'my_lists' user.email %}">My lists</a></li>
    </ul>
----
====


Moving Down One Layer to View Functions (the Controller)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Outside-In TDD", "controller layer")))That
will cause a template error, so we'll start to move down from the
presentation layer and URLs down to the controller layer, Django's view
functions.

As always, we start with a test:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_views.py (ch19l003)
====
[source,python]
----
class MyListsTest(TestCase):

    def test_my_lists_url_renders_my_lists_template(self):
        response = self.client.get('/lists/users/a@b.com/')
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'my_lists.html')
----
====

That gives:

----
AssertionError: No templates used to render the response
----

And we fix it, still at the presentation level, in 'urls.py':


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/urls.py
====
[source,python]
----
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^new$', views.new_list, name='new_list'),
    url(r'^(\d+)/$', views.view_list, name='view_list'),
    url(r'^users/(.+)/$', views.my_lists, name='my_lists'),
]
----
====
//004

That gives us a test failure, which informs us of what we should do as we
move down to the next level:

----
AttributeError: module 'lists.views' has no attribute 'my_lists'
----



We move in from the presentation layer to the views layer, and create a
minimal placeholder:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch19l005)
====
[source,python]
----
def my_lists(request, email):
    return render(request, 'my_lists.html')
----
====

And a minimal template:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/my_lists.html
====
[source,html]
----
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header_text %}My Lists{% endblock %}
----
====

That gets our unit tests passing, but our FT is still at the same point,
saying that the "My Lists" page doesn't yet show any lists.  It wants
them to be clickable links named after the first item:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests.test_my_lists*]
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: Reticulate splines
----


Another Pass, Outside-In
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Outside-In TDD", "FT-driven development", id="OITDDft22")))At
each stage, we still let the FT drive what development we do.

Starting again at the outside layer, in the template, we begin to
write the template code we'd like to use to get the "My Lists" page to
work the  way we want it to. As we do so, we start to specify the API
we want from the code at the layers below.


A Quick Restructure of the Template Inheritance Hierarchy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



((("templates", "inheritance hierarchy")))Currently
there's no place in our base template for us to put any new
content.  Also, the "My Lists" page doesn't need the new item form, so
we'll put that into a block too, making it optional:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch19l007-1)
====
[source,html]
----
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 jumbotron">
          <div class="text-center">
            <h1>{% block header_text %}{% endblock %}</h1>
            {% block list_form %}
              <form method="POST" action="{% block form_action %}{% endblock %}">
                {{ form.text }}
                {% csrf_token %}
                {% if form.errors %}
                  <div class="form-group has-error">
                    <div class="help-block">{{ form.text.errors }}</div>
                  </div>
                {% endif %}
              </form>
            {% endblock %}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
----
====

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch19l007-2)
====
[source,html]
----
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
          {% block table %}
          {% endblock %}
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
          {% block extra_content %}
          {% endblock %}
        </div>
      </div>

    </div>
    <script src="/static/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
    [...]
----
====


Designing Our API Using the Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("templates", "designing APIs using")))Meanwhile, in 'my_lists.html' we override the `list_form` and say it should
be empty...

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/my_lists.html
====
[source,html]
----
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header_text %}My Lists{% endblock %}

{% block list_form %}{% endblock %}
----
====

And then we can just work inside the `extra_content` block:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/my_lists.html
====
[source,html]
----
[...]

{% block list_form %}{% endblock %}

{% block extra_content %}
    <h2>{{ owner.email }}'s lists</h2>  <1>
    <ul>
        {% for list in owner.list_set.all %}  <2>
            <li><a href="{{ list.get_absolute_url }}">{{ list.name }}</a></li>  <3>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endblock %}
----
====

We've made several design decisions in this template which are going
to filter their way down through the code:

<1> We want a variable called `owner` to represent the user in our template.

<2> We want to be able to iterate through the lists created by the user using
    `owner.list_set.all` (I happen to know we get this for free from the Django
    ORM).

<3> We want to use `list.name` to print out the "name" of the list, which is
    currently specified as the text of its first element.

NOTE: Outside-In TDD is sometimes called "programming by wishful thinking",
    and you can see why.  We start writing code at the higher levels based on
    what we wish we had at the lower levels, even though it doesn't exist yet!
    

We can rerun our FTs, to check that we didn't break anything, and to see whether
we've got any further:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: Reticulate splines

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 8 tests in 77.613s

FAILED (errors=1)
----

Well, no further, but at least we didn't break anything. Time for a commit:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git add lists*
$ *git diff --staged*
$ *git commit -m "url, placeholder view, and first-cut templates for my_lists"*
----


Moving Down to the Next Layer: What the View Passes to the Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("templates", "views layer and")))Now
our views layer needs to respond to the requirements we've laid out in the template layer, by giving it the objects it needs.  In this case, the list owner:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_views.py (ch19l011)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
User = get_user_model()
[...]
class MyListsTest(TestCase):

    def test_my_lists_url_renders_my_lists_template(self):
        [...]

    def test_passes_correct_owner_to_template(self):
        User.objects.create(email='wrong@owner.com')
        correct_user = User.objects.create(email='a@b.com')
        response = self.client.get('/lists/users/a@b.com/')
        self.assertEqual(response.context['owner'], correct_user)
----
====

Gives:

----
KeyError: 'owner'
----

So:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch19l012)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
User = get_user_model()
[...]

def my_lists(request, email):
    owner = User.objects.get(email=email)
    return render(request, 'my_lists.html', {'owner': owner})
----
====

That gets our new test passing, but we'll also see an error from
the previous test. We just need to add a user for it as well:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_views.py (ch19l013)
====
[source,python]
----
    def test_my_lists_url_renders_my_lists_template(self):
        User.objects.create(email='a@b.com')
        [...]
----
====

((("", startref="OITDDft22")))And
we get to an OK:


----
OK
----


The Next "Requirement" from the Views Layer: New Lists Should Record Owner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Outside-In TDD", "views layer")))Before
we move down to the model layer, there's another part of the code
at the views layer that will need to use our model:  we need some way for
newly created lists to be assigned to an owner, if the current user is 
logged in to the site.

Here's a first crack at writing the test:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_views.py (ch19l014)
====
[source,python]
----
class NewListTest(TestCase):
    [...]

    def test_list_owner_is_saved_if_user_is_authenticated(self):
        user = User.objects.create(email='a@b.com')
        self.client.force_login(user)  #<1>
        self.client.post('/lists/new', data={'text': 'new item'})
        list_ = List.objects.first()
        self.assertEqual(list_.owner, user)
----
====

<1> `force_login()` is the way you get the test client to make requests
    with a logged-in user.

The test fails as follows:

----
AttributeError: 'List' object has no attribute 'owner'
----

To fix this, we can try writing code like this:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch19l015)
====
[source,python]
----
def new_list(request):
    form = ItemForm(data=request.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
        list_ = List()
        list_.owner = request.user
        list_.save()
        form.save(for_list=list_)
        return redirect(list_)
    else:
        return render(request, 'home.html', {"form": form})
----
====
//015

But it won't actually work, because we don't know how to save a list owner yet:




----
    self.assertEqual(list_.owner, user)
AttributeError: 'List' object has no attribute 'owner'
----


A Decision Point: Whether to Proceed to the Next Layer with a Failing Test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


((("Outside-In TDD", "model layer", id="OITDDmodel21")))In
order to get this test passing, as it's written now, we have to move
down to the model layer.  However, it means doing more work with a failing
test, which is not ideal.

((("mocks", "isolating tests using")))The
alternative is to rewrite the test to make it more 'isolated' from the
level below, using mocks.

On the one hand, it's a lot more effort to use mocks, and it can lead to
tests that are harder to read.  On the other hand, imagine if our app was more
complex, and there were several more layers between the outside and the inside.
Imagine leaving three or four or five layers of tests, all failing while we
wait to get to the bottom layer to implement our critical feature.  While tests
are failing, we're not sure that layer really works, on its own terms, or not.
We have to wait until we get to the bottom layer.

This is a decision point you're likely to run into in your own projects. Let's
investigate both approaches.  We'll start by taking the shortcut, and leaving
the test failing.  In the next chapter, we'll come back to this exact point,
and investigate how things would have gone if we'd used more isolation.

Let's do a commit, and then 'tag' the commit as a way of remembering our 
position for the next chapter:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git commit -am "new_list view tries to assign owner but cant"*
$ *git tag revisit_this_point_with_isolated_tests*
----


Moving Down to the Model Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our outside-in design has driven out two requirements for the model layer:
we want to be able to assign an owner to a list using the attribute
`.owner`, and we want to be able to access the list's owner with 
the API `owner.list_set.all`.

Let's write a test for that:
 

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py (ch19l018)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
User = get_user_model()
[...]

class ListModelTest(TestCase):

    def test_get_absolute_url(self):
        [...]

    def test_lists_can_have_owners(self):
        user = User.objects.create(email='a@b.com')
        list_ = List.objects.create(owner=user)
        self.assertIn(list_, user.list_set.all())
----
====

And that gives us a new unit test failure:

----
    list_ = List.objects.create(owner=user)
    [...]
TypeError: 'owner' is an invalid keyword argument for this function
----

The naive implementation would be this:

[role="skipme"]
[source,python]
----
from django.conf import settings
[...]

class List(models.Model):
    owner = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
----

But we want to make sure the list owner is optional.  Explicit
is better than implicit, and tests are documentation, so let's have a test for
that too:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py (ch19l020)
====
[source,python]
----
    def test_list_owner_is_optional(self):
        List.objects.create()  # should not raise
----
====

The correct implementation is this:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/models.py
====
[source,python]
----
from django.conf import settings
[...]

class List(models.Model):
    owner = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, blank=True, null=True)

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('view_list', args=[self.id])
----
====
//21

Now running the tests gives the usual database error:

Because we need to make some migrations:

We're almost there; a couple more failures:

----

We're moving back up to the views layer now, just doing a little 
tidying up. Notice that these are in the old test for the `new_list` view, when
we haven't got a logged-in user.  We should only save the list owner when the
user is actually logged in.  The `.is_authenticated` attribute we defined in
<<chapter_18_spiking_custom_auth>> comes in useful now (when they're not logged in,
Django represents users using a class called `AnonymousUser`, whose 
`.is_authenticated` is always `False`):

    if form.is_valid():
        list_ = List()

        list_.save()
        form.save(for_list=list_)

And that gets us passing!

Final Step: Feeding Through the .name API from the Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The last thing our outside-in design wanted came from the templates,
which wanted to be able to access a list "name" based on the text of
its first item:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py (ch19l024)
====
[source,python]
----
    def test_list_name_is_first_item_text(self):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(list=list_, text='first item')
        Item.objects.create(list=list_, text='second item')
        self.assertEqual(list_.name, 'first item')
----
====


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/models.py (ch19l025)
====
[source,python]
----
    @property
    def name(self):
        return self.item_set.first().text
----
====

And that, believe it or not, actually gets us a passing test, 
and a working "My Lists" page (<<my-lists-page>>)!

.The @property Decorator in Python
*******************************************************************************

((("@property decorator")))((("decorators", "property decorator")))((("Python 3", "@property decorator")))If
you haven't seen it before, the `@property` decorator transforms a method
on a class to make it appear to the outside world like an attribute.


((("duck typing")))This
is a powerful feature of the language, because it makes it easy to 
implement "duck typing", to change the implementation of a property without
changing the interface of the class.  In other words, if we decide to change
`.name` into being a "real" attribute on the model, which is stored as text in
the database, then we will be able to do so entirely transparently--as far as
the rest of our code is concerned, they will still be able to just access
`.name` and get the list name, without needing to know about the
implementation. Raymond Hettinger gave a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTLu2DFOdTg[great, beginner-friendly talk on
this topic at Pycon a few years ago], which I enthusiastically recommend (it
covers about a million good practices for Pythonic class design besides).

Of course, in the Django template language, `.name` would still call the method
even if it didn't have `@property`, but that's a particularity of Django, and
doesn't apply to Python in general...
*******************************************************************************

((("", startref="OITDDmodel21")))But
we know we cheated to get there.  The Testing Goat is eyeing us
suspiciously.  We left a test failing at one layer while we implemented its
dependencies at the lower layer. Let's see how things would play out if we were
to use better test isolation...

.Outside-In TDD
*******************************************************************************

Outside-In TDD::
    ((("Outside-In TDD", "defined")))A
methodology for building code, driven by tests, which proceeds by
    starting from the "outside" layers (presentation, GUI), and moving
    "inwards" step by step, via view/controller layers, down towards 
    the model layer.  The idea is to drive the design of your code from
    the use to which it is going to be put, rather than trying to anticipate
    requirements from the ground up.
    

Programming by wishful thinking::
    ((("programming by wishful thinking")))The
outside-in process is sometimes called "programming by wishful
    thinking".  Actually, any kind of TDD involves some wishful thinking. 
    We're always writing tests for things that don't exist yet.
    

The pitfalls of outside-in::
    ((("Outside-In TDD", "drawbacks of")))Outside-in isn't a silver bullet.  It encourages us to focus on things
    that are immediately visible to the user, but it won't automatically 
    remind us to write other critical tests that are less user-visible--things like security, for example. You'll need to remember them yourself.((("", startref="TTDoutside22")))
