== Making our App Production-Ready

Our container is working fine but it's not production-ready.
Let's try to get it there, using the tests to keep us safe.

In a way we're applying the Red-Green-Refactor cycle to our productionisation process.
Our hacky container config got us to Green, and now we're going to Refactor,
working incrementally (just as we would while coding),
trying to move from working state to working state,
and using the FTs to detect any regressions.

As part of my work on the third edition of the book,
I'm making big changes to the deployment chapters.
This chapter is still very fresh, but the content is all there,
so you should be able to follow along.

But as always I really, really need fedback.
So please hit me up at obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com, or via

=== What We Need to Do

What's wrong with our hacky container image?
A few things: first, we need to host our app on the "normal" port 80
so that people can access it using a regular URL.

Perhaps more importantly, we shouldn't use the Django dev server for production;
it's not designed for real-life workloads.
Instead, we'll use the popular Gunicorn Python WSGI HTTP server.

((("DEBUG settings")))
In addition, several options in _settings.py_ are currently unacceptable.
`DEBUG=True`, is strongly discouraged for production,
// CSANAD: I think this statement is clearer like this - but I would consider
//         using an even stronger expression, such as "strictly forbidden for
// production"
we'll want to set a unique `SECRET_KEY`,
and as we'll see, other things will come up.

Let's go through and see if we can fix things one by one.



=== Switching to Gunicorn

((("production-ready deployment", "using Gunicorn", secondary-sortas="Gunicorn")))
((("Gunicorn", "switching to")))
Do you know why the Django mascot is a pony?
The story is that Django comes with so many things you want:
an ORM, all sorts of middleware, the admin site...
"What else do you want, a pony?" Well, Gunicorn stands for "Green Unicorn",
which I guess is what you'd want next if you already had a pony...


Gunicorn is a WSGI (usually pronounced as whizgee) HTTP server. Let's go
through what this means:

* An HTTP server handles incoming HTTP requests and sends back responses to the
  clients.

* WSGI, the Web Server Gateway Interface, is a set of rules defining how an HTTP
  server (which can be Gunicorn itself, or Nginx, Apache, etc) and a Python
  program should communicate.

So, Gunicorn is an HTTP server that knows and uses the WSGI to "talk" to Python
programs. And these Python programs are likewise expected to work in a specific
way. You can check out a simple example https://gunicorn.org/[on Gunicorn's
website] under "Installation".
https://peps.python.org/pep-3333[If you are interested, you can read the entire
specification here].

What Django's `runserver` does is it launches a simple HTTP server which is
designed for development: it handles automatic reloading upon saving of the
source code and displays verbose information about errors and the entire
callstack, while serving one user. All of which is amazing for debugging.

And, none of which is ideal for serving real users in a production environment
and for minimising the chance of leaking sensitive data.

We should use an HTTP server that's designed for the job.
Let's install Gunicorn!

// CSANAD:  I felt like some explanation regarding what Gunicorn and WSGI are,
//          was missing.

//001

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip install gunicorn*
Collecting gunicorn
[...]
Successfully installed gunicorn-21.2.0
$ *pip freeze | grep -i gunicorn== >> requirements.txt*
----

We mentioned above that these Python programs should also implement the WSGI
in order to be able to talk to a WSGI server.
Gunicorn will need to know a path to a WSGI application to talk to.
Luckily, Django provides this in 'superlists/wsgi.py'.

Let's change the command our image runs:

[role="sourcecode"]
.Dockerfile (ch10l002)
====
[source,Dockerfile]
----
CMD gunicorn --bind :8888 superlists.wsgi:application
----
====
// CSANAD:  shouldn't we try it out before adding this to the Dockerfile?
//          `cd src` and then
// `gunicorn --bind :8888 superlists.wsgi:application`

As in the previous chapter, we can use the `docker build && docker run`
pattern to try out our changes by rebuilding and rerunning our container:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  --mount type=bind,source=./src,target=/src \
  -it superlists*
----
// CSANAD:  mounting only the db is no longer sufficient. Without mounting the
//          source code we would need to re-build the image to see the changes
// we make in e.g. settings.py. I'll get back to this below.
// TODO: write a few words on mounting the entire /src and a reason for doing so


==== The FTs catch a problem with static files

As we run the functional tests, you'll see them warning us of a problem, once again.
The test for adding list items passes happily,
but the test for layout + styling fails. Good job, tests!

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python src/manage.py test src/functional_tests*]
[...]
AssertionError: 102.5 != 512 within 10 delta (409.5 difference)
FAILED (failures=1)
----

And indeed, if you take a look at the site, you'll find the CSS is all broken,
as in <<site-with-broken-css>>.

The reason that we have no CSS is that although the Django dev server will
serve static files magically for you, Gunicorn doesn't.


[[site-with-broken-css]]
.Broken CSS
image::images/twp2_1001.png["The site is up, but CSS is broken"]


One step forward, one step backward,
but once again we've identified the problem nice and early.
Moving on!


=== Serving Static Files with Whitenoise

Serving static files is very different from serving
dynamically rendered content from Python and Django.
There are many ways to serve them in production:
you can use a web server like Nginx, or a CDN like Amazon S3,
but in our case, the most straightforward thing to do
is to use https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/[Whitenoise],
a Python library expressly designed for serving staticfootnote:[
Believe it or not, this pun didn't actually hit me until I was rewriting this chapter.
For 10 years it was right under my nose. I think that makes it funnier actually.]
files from Python.

Let's install it first:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip install whitenoise*
$ *pip freeze | grep -i whitenoise== >> requirements.txt*
----

Then we tell Django to enable it:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/settings.py (ch10l003)
====
[source,python]
----
MIDDLEWARE = [
    "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
    "whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware",
    "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
    [...]

----
====
// CSANAD:  I would add a few thoughts on the significance of the order of
//          middlewares.

And if you take another manual look at your site after restarting the
container, things should look much healthier.
// CSANAD:  as I mentioned above, mounting only the db would not result in this
//          error being fixed.
Let's rerun our FTs to confirm:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python src/manage.py test src/functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]

...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 10.718s

OK
----

Phew.  Let's commit that

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git commit -am"Switch to Gunicorn and Whitenoise"*
----


=== Using Environment Variables to Adjust Settings for Production

((("DEBUG settings")))
We know there are several things in
_settings.py_ that we want to change for production:


* `DEBUG` mode is all very well for hacking about on your own server,
  but it https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#debug[isn't secure].
  For example, exposing raw tracebacks to the world is a bad idea.

* `SECRET_KEY` is used by Django for some of its crypto--things
  like cookies and CSRF protection.
  It's good practice to make sure the secret key in production is different
  from the one in your source code repo,
  because that code might be visible to strangers.
  We'll want to generate a new, random one
  but then keep it the same for the foreseeable future
  (find out more in the https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/signing/[Django docs]).

Development, staging and production sites always have some differences
in their configuration.
Environment variables are a good place to store those different settings.
See http://www.clearlytech.com/2014/01/04/12-factor-apps-plain-english/[
"The 12-Factor App"].footnote:[
Another common way of handling this
is to have different versions of _settings.py_ for dev and prod.
That can work fine too, but it can get confusing to manage.
Environment variables also have the advantage of working for non-Django stuff too...
]


==== Setting DEBUG=True and SECRET_KEY

There are lots of ways you might do this.
Here's what I propose; it may seem a little fiddly,
but I'll provide a little justification for each choice.
Let them be an inspiration (but not a template) for your own choices!


[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch10l005)
====
[source,python]
----
import os
[...]

if "DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE" in os.environ:  #<1>
    DEBUG = False
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ["DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"]  #<2>
else:
    DEBUG = True  #<3>
    SECRET_KEY = "insecure-key-for-dev"
----
====

<1> We say we'll use an environment variable called `DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE`
    to switch debug mode off, and in effect require production settings
    (it doesn't matter what we set it to, just that it's there).

<2> And now we say that, if debug mode is off,
    we _require_ the `SECRET_KEY` to be set by a second environment variable.

<3> Otherwise we fall-back to the insecure, debug mode settings that
    are useful for Dev.

The end result is that you don't need to set any env vars for dev,
but production needs both to be set explicitly,
and it will error if any are missing.
I think this gives us a little bit of protection
against accidentally forgetting to set one.

TIP: Better to fail hard than allow a typo in an environment variable name to
    leave you running with insecure settings.

==== Setting environment variables inside the Dockerfile

Now let's set that environment variable in our Dockerfile using the `ENV` directive:

[role="sourcecode"]
.Dockerfile (ch10l006)
====
[source,dockerfile]
----
WORKDIR /src

ENV DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE=1
CMD gunicorn --bind :8888 superlists.wsgi:application
----
====

And try it out...



[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:specialcharacters,quotes[*docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  --mount type=bind,source=./src,target=/src \
  -it superlists*]

[...]
  File "/src/superlists/settings.py", line 22, in <module>
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ["DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"]
                 ~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<frozen os>", line 685, in __getitem__
KeyError: 'DJANGO_SECRET_KEY'
----

Ooops, and I forgot to set said secret key env var,
mere seconds after having dreamt it up!


==== Setting Environment Variables at the Docker Command Line

We've said we can't keep the secret key in our source code,
so the Dockerfile isn't an option; where else can we put it?

For now, we can set it at the command line using the `-e` flag for `docker run`:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  --mount type=bind,source=./src,target=/src \
  -e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=sekrit \
  -it superlists*
----
// CSANAD: no need to rebuild here

With that running, we can use our FT again to see if we're back to a working state.

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 ./src/manage.py test src/functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]
AssertionError: 'To-Do' not found in 'Bad Request (400)'
----



==== ALLOWED_HOSTS is Required When Debug Mode is Turned Off

Not quite!  Let's take a look manually: <<django-400-error>>.

[[django-400-error]]
.An ugly 400 error
image::images/twp2_1002.png["An unfriendly page showing 400 Bad Request"]

We've set our two environment variables but doing so seems to have broken things.
But once again, by running our FTs frequently,
we're able to identify the problem early,
before we've changed too many things at the same time.
We've only changed two settings—which one might be at fault?

Let's use the "Googling the error message" technique again,
with the search terms "django debug false" and "400 bad request".

Well, the very first link in my https://duckduckgo.com/?q=django+400+bad+request[search results]
was Stackoverflow suggesting that a 400 error is usually to do with `ALLOWED_HOSTS`,
and the second was the official Django docs,
which takes a bit more scrolling, but confirms it
(see <<search-results-400-bad-request>>).

[[search-results-400-bad-request]]
.Search results for "django debug false 400 bad request"
image::images/search-results-400-bad-request.png["Duckduckgo search results with stackoverflow and django docs"]


`ALLOWED_HOSTS` is a security setting
designed to reject requests that are likely to be forged, broken or malicious
because they don't appear to be asking for your site
(HTTP requests contain the address they were intended for in a header called "Host").

By default, when DEBUG=True, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` effectively allows _localhost_,
our own machine, so that's why it was working OK until now.

There's more information in the
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts[Django docs].

The upshot is that we need to adjust `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in _settings.py_.
Let's use another environment variable for that:


[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch10l007)
====
[source,python]
----
if "DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE" in os.environ:
    DEBUG = False
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ["DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"]
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = [os.environ["DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOST"]]
else:
    DEBUG = True
    SECRET_KEY = "insecure-key-for-dev"
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = []
----
====

This is a setting that we want to change,
depending on whether our docker image is running locally,
or on a server, so we'll use the `-e` flag again:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker run \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    --mount type=bind,source=./src,target=/src \
    -e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=sekrit \
    -e DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOST=localhost \
    -it superlists*
----

// CSANAD: some thoughts would be nice here, e.g. rearranging the text a little
//         bit:
An FT run (or just looking at the site) reveals that we've had a regression
in our static files.

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python src/manage.py test src/functional_tests*]
[...]
AssertionError: 102.5 != 512 within 10 delta (409.5 difference)
FAILED (failures=1)
----

Our webpage is reachable, but once again, we seem to have broken the styling.


==== Collectstatic is Required when Debug is Turned Off


We saw this before when switching from the Django dev server to Gunicorn,
so we introduced Whitenoise.
We didn't touch Whitenoise, so what went wrong this time?

There was a clue all along in the logs:
`UserWarning: No directory at: /src/static/`"

If we check our settings.py we can see a `STATIC_ROOT` whose value is exactly
`BASE_DIR / "static"`

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/static-files/#configuring-static-files[
The Django docs on static files] explain that
when we switch DEBUG off,
Django stops automagically serving static files in our code,
and instead we need to run `collectstatic`:
// CSANAD: unfortunately this is explained in two different pages and I didn't
//         want to add too many links. Serving of the static files is explained
// on the linked page in the "Serving the files" box.
// Then "How to deploy static files" redirects to another page that says
// running `collectstatic` is the way. I think we should show the process of
// finding such crucial instructions.


[subs="quotes"]
----
$ *python src/manage.py collectstatic*
----
// CSANAD: doing this in the image does not work because:
//         - `docker run --mount` should mount src/
//         - but then, since the host system's src/ does not have a static/
// directory (yet), mounting it would result in removing the "baked in" static/
// from the container.
// ps.: oh I just noticed, this is quite similar to `manage.py migrate` in the
// 9th chapter.

Well, it was fiddly, but that should get us to passing tests!


[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python src/manage.py test src/functional_tests*]
[...]
OK
----

We have a container that we're ready to ship to production!

Find out how in the next exciting installment...
// CSANAD: now would be a good time to check our changes and notice git marked
//         src/static as unstaged, so we should update .gitignore accordingly:
// from `static` to `src/static`.
// Or we could add this step to Chapter 09 at "Move all our code into a src
// folder"


=== Configuring logging

One last thing we'll want to do is make sure that we can get logs out of our server.
If things go wrong, we want to be able to get to the tracebacks, and as we'll soon see,
switching DEBUG off means that Django's default logging configuration changes.


==== Provoking a deliberate error

To test this, we'll provoke a deliberate error by deleting the database file.



[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *rm src/db.sqlite3 && touch src/db.sqlite3*
----

TIP: If you use the `-v` option for docker run to mount a nonexistent path,
    Docker will create a new folder at that path.
    This is why we do the `touch db.sqlite3`
    so that we have a placeholder empty file where the datbase should be.
    Otherwise we get a folder instead of an empty file and django gets even more confused;
    if you ever see an error saying `chown: permission denied`, that's probably it.
    Do a `rm -rf src/db.sqlite3 && touch src/db.sqlite3` to fix it.



Now if you run the tests, you'll see they fail;

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 ./src/manage.py test src/functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]

selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: [id="id_list_table"]; [...]
----

And you might spot in the browser that we just see a minimal error page,
with no debug info (try it manually if you like):

[[minimal-error-page]]
.Minimal default server error 500
image::images/server_error_500.png["A minimal error page saying just Server error (500)"]


But if you look in your docker terminal, you'll see there is no traceback:

----
[2024-02-28 10:41:53 +0000] [7] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
[2024-02-28 10:41:53 +0000] [7] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8888 (7)
[2024-02-28 10:41:53 +0000] [7] [INFO] Using worker: sync
[2024-02-28 10:41:53 +0000] [8] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 8
----


Where have the tracebacks gone?
You might have been expecting that the django debug page and its tracebacks
would disappear from our web browser,
but it's more of shock to see that they are no longer appearing in the terminal either!
If you're like me you might find yourself wondering if we really _did_ see them earlier
and starting to doubt your own sanity.
But the explanation is that Django's
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/logging/#default-logging-configuration[default logging configuration]
changes when DEBUG is turned off:

This means we need to interact with the standard library's `logging` module,
unfortunately one of the most fiddly parts of the Python standard libraryfootnote:[
It's not necessarily for bad reasons, but it is all very Java-ey and enterprisey.
I mean, yes, separating the concepts of handlers and loggers and filters,
and making it all configurable in a nested hierarchy is all well and good
and covers every possible use case,
but sometimes you just wanna say "just print stuff to stdout pls",
and you wish that configuring the simplest thing was a little easier].

Here's pretty much the simplest possible logging config
which just prints everything to the console (i.e. standard out).


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/settings.py (ch10l009)
====
[source,python]
----
LOGGING = {
    "version": 1,
    "disable_existing_loggers": False,
    "handlers": {
        "console": {"class": "logging.StreamHandler"},
    },
    "loggers": {
        "root": {"handlers": ["console"], "level": "INFO"},
    },
}
----
====

Restart our container,
try the FT again (or submitting a new list item manually)
and we now should see a clear error message:


----
Internal Server Error: /lists/new
Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
  File "/src/lists/views.py", line 10, in new_list
    nulist = List.objects.create()

  File "/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py",
  line 328, in execute
    return super().execute(query, params)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: lists_list
----

Re-create the datase with `./src/manage.py migrate` and we'll be back to a working state.

Don't forget to commit our changes to _settings.py_,
and I think we can call it job done!
We've at least touched on many or most of the things you might need to think about
when considering production-readiness,
we've worked in small steps and used our tests all the way along,
and we're now ready to deploy our container to a real server!


[role="pagebreak-before less_space"]
.Production-Readiness Config
*******************************************************************************

((("production-ready deployment", "best practices for")))
A few things to think about when trying to prepare a production-ready configuration:

Don't use the Django dev server in production::
  Something like Gunicorn or uWSGI is a better tool for running Django;
  it will let you run multiple workers, for example.
  ((("Gunicorn", "benefits of")))

Decide how to serve your static files::
  Static files aren't the same kind of things as the dynamic content
  that comes from Django and your webapp, so they need to be treated differently.
  WhiteNoise is just one example of how you might do that.

Check your settings.py for dev-only config::
  `DEBUG=True`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `SECRET_KEY` are the ones we came across,
  but you will probably have others
  (we'll see more when we start to send emails from the server).

Change things one at a time and rerun your tests frequently::
  Whenever we make a change to our server configuration,
  we can rerun the test suite,
  and either be confident that everything works as well as it did before,
  or find out immediately if we did something wrong.

Think about logging and observability::
  When things go wrong, you need to be able to find out what happened.
  At a minimum you need a way of getting logs and tracebacks out of your server,
  and in more advanced environments you'll want to think about metrics and tracing too.
  But we can't cover all that in this book!

*******************************************************************************
