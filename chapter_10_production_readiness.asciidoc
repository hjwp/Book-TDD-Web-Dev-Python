Our container is working fine but it's not production-ready.
Let's try to get it there, using the tests to keep us safe.

In a way we're applying the Red-Green-Refactor cycle to our productionisation process.
Our hacky container config got us to Green, and now we're going to Refactor,
working incrementally (just as we would while coding),
trying to move from working state to working state,
and using the FTs to detect any regressions.


.Warning, Fresh Content

=== What We Need to Do

What's wrong with our hacky container image?
A few things: first, we need to host our app on the "normal" port 80
so that people can access it using a regular URL.

Perhaps more importantly, we shouldn't use the Django dev server for production;
it's not designed for real-life workloads.
Instead, we'll use the popular Gunicorn Python WSGI HTTP server.

NOTE: Django's `runserver` is built and optimised for local development and debugging.
  It's designed to handle one user at a time,
  it handles automatic reloading upon saving of the source code,
  but it isn't optimised for performance,
  nor has it been hardened against security vulnerabilities.

((("DEBUG settings")))
In addition, several options in _settings.py_ are currently unacceptable.
`DEBUG=True`, is strongly discouraged for production,
we'll want to set a unique `SECRET_KEY`,
and, as we'll see, other things will come up.

WARNING: DEBUG=True is considered a security risk,
  because the django debug page will display sensitive information like
  the values of variables, and most of the settings in settings.py.


Let's go through and see if we can fix things one by one.

// SEBASTIAN: How about linking to Django's documentation
//      https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/howto/deployment/

=== Switching to Gunicorn

((("production-ready deployment", "using Gunicorn", secondary-sortas="Gunicorn")))
((("Gunicorn", "switching to")))
Do you know why the Django mascot is a pony?
The story is that Django comes with so many things you want:
an ORM, all sorts of middleware, the admin site...
"What else do you want, a pony?" Well, Gunicorn stands for "Green Unicorn",
which I guess is what you'd want next if you already had a pony...

We'll need to first install Gunicorn into our container,
and then use it instead of `runserver`:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python -m pip install gunicorn*
Collecting gunicorn
[...]
Successfully installed gunicorn-2[...]
----


Gunicorn will need to know a path to a "WSGI server"footnote:[
WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface and is the protocol
for communication between a web server and a Python web application.
Gunicorn is a web sever that uses WSGI to interact with Django,
and so is the web server you get from `runserver`.]
which is usually a function called `application`.
Django provides one in 'superlists/wsgi.py'.
Let's change the command our image runs:

[role="sourcecode"]
.Dockerfile (ch10l001)
====
[source,dockerfile]
----
[...]
RUN pip install "django<6" gunicorn  # <1>

COPY src /src

WORKDIR /src

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", ":8888", "superlists.wsgi:application"]  # <2>
----
====

<1> Installation is a standard pip install.

<2> Gunicorn has its own command line, `gunicorn`.
  It needs to know a path to a WSGI server,
  which is usually a function called `application`.
  Django provides one in _superlists/wsgi.py_.

As in the previous chapter, we can use the `docker build && docker run`
pattern to try out our changes by rebuilding and rerunning our container:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  --mount type=bind,source="$PWD/src/db.sqlite3",target=/src/db.sqlite3 \
  -it superlists*
----

TIP: If you see an error saying
  `Bind for 0.0.0.0:8888 failed: port is already allocated.`,
  it'll be because you still have a container running from the previous chapter.
  Do you remember how to use `docker ps`, and `docker stop`?
  If not, have another look at <<how-to-stop-a-docker-container>>.

==== The FTs catch a problem with static files

As we run the functional tests, you'll see them warning us of a problem, once again.
The test for adding list items passes happily,
but the test for layout + styling fails. Good job, tests!

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python src/manage.py test functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]
AssertionError: 102.5 != 512 within 10 delta (409.5 difference)
FAILED (failures=1)
----

And indeed, if you take a look at the site, you'll find the CSS is all broken,
as in <<site-with-broken-css>>.

The reason that we have no CSS is that although the Django dev server will
serve static files magically for you, Gunicorn doesn't.


[[site-with-broken-css]]
.Broken CSS
image::images/homepage_no_css_8888.png["The site is up, but CSS is broken"]


One step forward, one step backward,
but once again we've identified the problem nice and early.
Moving on!


=== Serving Static Files with Whitenoise

Serving static files is very different from serving
dynamically rendered content from Python and Django.
There are many ways to serve them in production:
you can use a web server like Nginx, or a CDN like Amazon S3,
but in our case, the most straightforward thing to do
is to use https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/[Whitenoise],
a Python library expressly designed for serving staticfootnote:[
Believe it or not, this pun didn't actually hit me until I was rewriting this chapter.
For 10 years it was right under my nose. I think that makes it funnier actually.]
files from Python.

// DAVID: It might be worth pointing out what Whitenoise is actually doing.
// From what I understand, we're still using Django to serve static files.

First we install Whitenoise into our local environment:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
*pip install whitenoise*
----

Then we tell Django to enable it, in _settings.py_footnote:[
Find out more about Django Middleware
in https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/http/middleware/[the docs].
]:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/settings.py (ch10l002)
====
[source,python]
----
MIDDLEWARE = [
    "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
    "whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware",
    "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
    [...]

----
====

And then we need to add it to our pip installs in the Dockerfile:

[role="sourcecode"]
.Dockerfile (ch10l003)
====
[source,dockerfile]
----
RUN pip install "django<6" gunicorn whitenoise
----
====

This manual list of pip installs is getting a little fiddly!
We'll come back to that in a moment.
First let's rebuild and try re-running our FTs:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  --mount type=bind,source="$PWD/src/db.sqlite3",target=/src/db.sqlite3 \
  -it superlists*
----

And if you take another manual look at your site, things should look much healthier.
Let's rerun our FTs to confirm:


[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python src/manage.py test functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]

...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 10.718s

OK
----


Phew.  Let's commit that:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git commit -am"Switch to Gunicorn and Whitenoise"*
----



=== Using requirements.txt

Let's deal with that fiddly list of pip installs.

To reproduce our local virtualenv,
rather than just manually pip installing things
one by one, and having to remember to sync things
between local dev and docker,
we can "save" the list of packages we're using
by creating a _requirements.txt_ file.footnote:[
There are many other dependency management tools these days
so requirements.txt is not the only way to do it,
although it is one of the oldest and best established.
As you continue your Python adventures
I'm sure you'll come across many others.]


The `pip freeze` command will show us everything that's installed in our virtualenv at the moment:


// version numbers change too much
[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip freeze*
asgiref==3.8.1
attrs==25.3.0
certifi==2025.4.26
Django==5.2
gunicorn==23.0.0
h11==0.16.0
idna==3.10
outcome==1.3.0.post0
packaging==25.0
PySocks==1.7.1
selenium==4.31.0
sniffio==1.3.1
sortedcontainers==2.4.0
sqlparse==0.5.3
trio==0.30.0
trio-websocket==0.12.2
typing_extensions==4.13.2
urllib3==2.4.0
websocket-client==1.8.0
whitenoise==6.9.0
wsproto==1.2.0
----

That shows _all_ the packages in our virtualenv,
along with their version numbers.
Let's pull out just the "top-level" dependencies,
Django, Gunicorn and Whitenoise:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip freeze | grep -i django*
Django==5.2[...]

$ *pip freeze | grep -i django >> requirements.txt*
$ *pip freeze | grep -i gunicorn >> requirements.txt*
$ *pip freeze | grep -i whitenoise >> requirements.txt*
----

That should give us a requirements.txt file that looks like this:


[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.requirements.txt (ch10l004)
====
[source,python]
----
django==5.2
gunicorn==23.0.0
whitenoise==6.9.0
----
====

Let's try it out!  To install things from a _requirements.txt_ file,
you use the `-r` flag, like this:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip install -r requirements.txt*
Requirement already satisfied: Django==5.2 in
...goat-book/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages (from -r requirements.txt (line
1)) (5.2)
Requirement already satisfied: gunicorn==23.0.0 in
...goat-book/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages (from -r requirements.txt (line
2)) (23.0.0)
Requirement already satisfied: whitenoise==6.9.0 in
...goat-book/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages (from -r requirements.txt (line
3)) (6.9.0)
Requirement already satisfied: asgiref[...]
Requirement already satisfied: sqlparse[...]
[...]
----

As you can see, it's a no-op because we already have everything installed.
That's expected!


TIP: Forgetting the `-r` and running `pip install requirements.txt`
    is such a common error, that I recommend you do it _right now_
    and get familiar with the error message
    (which is thankfully much more helpful than it used to be).
    It's a mistake I still make, _all the time_.


Anyway, that's a good first version of a requirements file, let's commit it:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git add requirements.txt*
$ *git commit -m "Add a requirements.txt with Django, gunicorn and whitenoise"*
----


.Dev dependencies, transitive dependencies, and lockfiles
*******************************************************************************
You may be wondering why we didn't add our other key dependency,
Selenium, to our requirements.
Or you might be wondering why we didn't just add _all_ the dependencies,
including the "transitive" ones
(eg, Django has its own dependencies like `asgiref` and `sqlparse` etc).

As always, I have to gloss over some nuance and tradeoffs,
but the short answer is:

* First, Selenium is only a dependency for the tests, not the application code;
  we're never going to run the tests directly on our production servers.

* As to transitive dependencies,
  they're fiddly to manage without bringing in more tools,
  and I didn't want to do that for this book.

When you have a moment, you should probably to do some further reading
on "lockfiles", pyproject.toml, hard pinning vs soft pining,
and immediate vs transitive dependencies.

If I absolutely _had_ to recommend a python dependency management tool,
it would be https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools[pip-tools],
which is a fairly minimal one.]
*******************************************************************************


Now let's see how we use that requirements file in our Dockerfile:

[role="sourcecode"]
.Dockerfile (ch10l005)
====
[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM python:3.13-slim

RUN python -m venv /venv
ENV PATH="/venv/bin:$PATH"

COPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt  # <1>
RUN pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt  # <2>

COPY src /src

WORKDIR /src

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", ":8888", "superlists.wsgi:application"]
----
====

<1> We COPY our requirements file in, just like the src folder.

<2> Now instead of just installing Django,
  we install all our dependencies using `pip install -r`.


Let's build & run:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  --mount type=bind,source="$PWD/src/db.sqlite3",target=/src/db.sqlite3 \
  -it superlists*
----

And then test to check everything still works:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python src/manage.py test functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]

OK
----

Hooray.

=== Using Environment Variables to Adjust Settings for Production

((("DEBUG settings")))
We know there are several things in
_settings.py_ that we want to change for production:


* `DEBUG` mode is all very well for hacking about on your own server,
  but it https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#debug[isn't secure].
  For example, exposing raw tracebacks to the world is a bad idea.

* `SECRET_KEY` is used by Django for some of its crypto--things
  like cookies and CSRF protection.
  It's good practice to make sure the secret key in production is different
  from the one in your source code repo,
  because that code might be visible to strangers.
  We'll want to generate a new, random one
  but then keep it the same for the foreseeable future
  (find out more in the https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/signing/[Django docs]).

Development, staging and production sites always have some differences
in their configuration.
Environment variables are a good place to store those different settings.
See http://www.clearlytech.com/2014/01/04/12-factor-apps-plain-english/[
"The 12-Factor App"].footnote:[
Another common way of handling this
is to have different versions of _settings.py_ for dev and prod.
That can work fine too, but it can get confusing to manage.
Environment variables also have the advantage of working for non-Django stuff too.
]


==== Setting DEBUG=True and SECRET_KEY

There are lots of ways you might set these settings.

Here's what I propose; it may seem a little fiddly,
but I'll provide a little justification for each choice.
Let them be an inspiration (but not a template) for your own choices!

Note that this if statement replaces the `DEBUG` and `SECRET_KEY` lines
that are included by default in the settings.py file:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/settings.py (ch10l006)
====
[source,python]
----
import os
[...]

# SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
if "DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE" in os.environ:  #<1>
    DEBUG = False
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ["DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"]  #<2>
else:
    DEBUG = True  #<3>
    SECRET_KEY = "insecure-key-for-dev"
----
====
// CSANAD: I think variable names like "something_false" are confusing, since
//         we need to set something to true so that they mean false.
// How about `DJANGO_ENV_PRODUCTION` or something similar?

<1> We say we'll use an environment variable called `DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE`
    to switch debug mode off, and in effect require production settings
    (it doesn't matter what we set it to, just that it's there).

<2> And now we say that, if debug mode is off,
    we _require_ the `SECRET_KEY` to be set by a second environment variable.

<3> Otherwise we fall-back to the insecure, debug mode settings that
    are useful for Dev.

The end result is that you don't need to set any env vars for dev,
but production needs both to be set explicitly,
and it will error if any are missing.
I think this gives us a little bit of protection
against accidentally forgetting to set one.

TIP: Better to fail hard than allow a typo in an environment variable name to
    leave you running with insecure settings.

// CSANAD: I think it would worth pointing out the development environment
//         does not use Docker, launching the dev server should be done from
// the reader's host system. I think this isn't immediately obvious, e.g. I
// thought all along that from now on we would only run the server from Docker.
// If we end up making a TIP or similar about it, I think we should also mention
// in a development environment relying on containerization, programmers usually
// mount the whole /src minimizing the time-consuming rebuilding of their images.


==== Setting environment variables inside the Dockerfile

Now let's set that environment variable in our Dockerfile using the `ENV` directive:

[role="sourcecode"]
.Dockerfile (ch10l007)
====
[source,dockerfile]
----
WORKDIR /src

ENV DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE=1

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", ":8888", "superlists.wsgi:application"]
----
====

And try it out...



[role="ignore-errors"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:specialcharacters,quotes[*docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  --mount type=bind,source="$PWD/src/db.sqlite3",target=/src/db.sqlite3 \
  -it superlists*]

[...]
  File "/src/superlists/settings.py", line 23, in <module>
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ["DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"]
                 ~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[...]
KeyError: 'DJANGO_SECRET_KEY'
----

Oops. I forgot to set said secret key env var,
mere seconds after having dreamt it up!

==== Setting Environment Variables at the Docker Command Line

We've said we can't keep the secret key in our source code,
so the Dockerfile isn't an option; where else can we put it?

For now, we can set it at the command line using the `-e` flag for `docker run`:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  --mount type=bind,source="$PWD/src/db.sqlite3",target=/src/db.sqlite3 \
  -e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=sekrit \
  -it superlists*
----

With that running, we can use our FT again to see if we're back to a working state.

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python src/manage.py test functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]
AssertionError: 'To-Do' not found in 'Bad Request (400)'
----


NOTE: The eagle-eyed might spot a message saying
    `UserWarning: No directory at: /src/static/`.
    That's a little clue about a problem with static files,
    that we're going to deal with shortly.
    Let's deal with this 400 issue first.



==== ALLOWED_HOSTS is Required When Debug Mode is Turned Off

It's not quite working yet!  Let's take a look manually: <<django-400-error>>.

[[django-400-error]]
.An unfriendly 400 error
image::images/django_400.png["Web page showing wth the text 400 Bad Request in default font"]

We've set our two environment variables but doing so seems to have broken things.
But once again, by running our FTs frequently,
we're able to identify the problem early,
before we've changed too many things at the same time.
We've only changed two settings—which one might be at fault?

Let's use the "Googling the error message" technique again,
with the search terms "django debug false" and "400 bad request".

Well, the very first link in my https://duckduckgo.com/?q=django+400+bad+request[search results]
was Stackoverflow suggesting that a 400 error is usually to do with `ALLOWED_HOSTS`,
and the second was the official Django docs,
which takes a bit more scrolling, but confirms it
(see <<search-results-400-bad-request>>).

[[search-results-400-bad-request]]
.Search results for "django debug false 400 bad request"
image::images/search-results-400-bad-request.png["Duckduckgo search results with stackoverflow and django docs"]


`ALLOWED_HOSTS` is a security setting
designed to reject requests that are likely to be forged, broken or malicious
because they don't appear to be asking for your site
(HTTP requests contain the address they were intended for in a header called "Host").

By default, when DEBUG=True, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` effectively allows _localhost_,
our own machine, so that's why it was working OK until now.

There's more information in the
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts[Django docs].

The upshot is that we need to adjust `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in _settings.py_.
Let's use another environment variable for that:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/settings.py (ch10l008)
====
[source,python]
----
if "DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE" in os.environ:
    DEBUG = False
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ["DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"]
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = [os.environ["DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOST"]]
else:
    DEBUG = True
    SECRET_KEY = "insecure-key-for-dev"
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = []
----
====

This is a setting that we want to change,
depending on whether our Docker image is running locally,
or on a server, so we'll use the `-e` flag again:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    --mount type=bind,source="$PWD/src/db.sqlite3",target=/src/db.sqlite3 \
    -e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=sekrit \
    -e DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOST=localhost \
    -it superlists*
----


==== Collectstatic is Required when Debug is Turned Off

An FT run (or just looking at the site) reveals that we've had a regression
in our static files:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python src/manage.py test functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]
AssertionError: 102.5 != 512 within 10 delta (409.5 difference)
FAILED (failures=1)
----

And you might have seen this warning message in the `docker run` output:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters"]
----
/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/core/handlers/base.py:61:
UserWarning: No directory at: /src/static/
  mw_instance = middleware(adapted_handler)
----

We saw this at the beginning of the chapter,
when switching from the Django dev server to Gunicorn,
and that was why we introduced Whitenoise.
Similarly, when we switch DEBUG off,
Whitenoise stops automagically finding static files in our code,
and instead we need to run `collectstatic`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.Dockerfile (ch10l009)
====
[source,dockerfile]
----
WORKDIR /src

RUN python manage.py collectstatic

ENV DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE=1

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", ":8888", "superlists.wsgi:application"]
----
====


// DAVID: Interestingly when I did this I put the RUN directive after the ENV
// directive, which led to a KeyError: 'DJANGO_SECRET_KEY' which foxed me for a bit.
// Might be worth calling out that we're running collectstatic in debug mode.



Well, it was fiddly, but that should get us to passing tests
after we build & run the docker container!

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    --mount type=bind,source="$PWD/src/db.sqlite3",target=/src/db.sqlite3 \
    -e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=sekrit \
    -e DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOST=localhost \
    -it superlists*
----

and...

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python src/manage.py test functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]
OK
----

We're nearly ready to ship to production!

Let's quickly adjust our gitignore, since the static folder is in a new place:

//0010
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status*
# should show dockerfile and untracked src/static folder
$ *echo src/static >> .gitignore*
$ *git status*
# should now be clean
$ *git commit -am "Add collectstatic to dockerfile, and new location to gitignore"*
----



=== Switching to a nonroot user

// CSANAD:  It's fine for now, but I would definitely put the requirements under
//          /tmp and then `rm` it after `pip install`. Also, using a non-privileged
// user is important, something like:
//     `adduser --no-create-home --disabled-password todoapp`
// and then setting the user in the Dockerfile with `USER todoapp`.
// But we can cover this in a later chapter (the next one looks like a good fit,
// since it's related to the app being production ready).
// TODO yep let's definitely do this.

TODO: apologies, WIP, this is definitely a good idea for security, needs writing up.

Dockerfile should gain some lines a bit like this:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.Dockerfile (ch10l0XX)
====
[source,dockerfile]
----
RUN addgroup --system nonroot && \
    adduser --system --no-create-home --disabled-password --group nonroot

USER nonroot
----
====


=== Configuring logging

One last thing we'll want to do is make sure that we can get logs out of our server.
If things go wrong, we want to be able to get to the tracebacks, and as we'll soon see,
switching DEBUG off means that Django's default logging configuration changes.


==== Provoking a deliberate error

To test this, we'll provoke a deliberate error by deleting the database file.



[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *rm src/db.sqlite3*
$ *touch src/db.sqlite3*  # otherwise the --mount type=bind will complain
----

Now if you run the tests, you'll see they fail;

// TODO: for some reason this wont repro in CI

[role="small-code pause-first skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python src/manage.py test functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]

selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: [id="id_list_table"]; [...]
----

// DAVID: Got me thinking, I'm not always clear when I need to rebuild the image.
// I would have thought I might need to do it here, but I didn't. Might be worth
// explaining in the previous chapter when we do.

And you might spot in the browser that we just see a minimal error page,
with no debug info (try it manually if you like):

[[minimal-error-page]]
.Minimal default server error 500
image::images/server_error_500.png["A minimal error page saying just Server error (500)"]


But if you look in your docker terminal, you'll see there is no traceback:

[role="skipme"]
----
[2024-02-28 10:41:53 +0000] [7] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
[2024-02-28 10:41:53 +0000] [7] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8888 (7)
[2024-02-28 10:41:53 +0000] [7] [INFO] Using worker: sync
[2024-02-28 10:41:53 +0000] [8] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 8
----


Where have the tracebacks gone?
You might have been expecting that the django debug page and its tracebacks
would disappear from our web browser,
but it's more of shock to see that they are no longer appearing in the terminal either!
If you're like me you might find yourself wondering if we really _did_ see them earlier
and starting to doubt your own sanity.
But the explanation is that Django's
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/logging/#default-logging-configuration[default logging configuration]
changes when DEBUG is turned off.

This means we need to interact with the standard library's `logging` module,
unfortunately one of the most fiddly parts of the Python standard libraryfootnote:[
It's not necessarily for bad reasons, but it is all very Java-ey and enterprisey.
I mean, yes, separating the concepts of handlers and loggers and filters,
and making it all configurable in a nested hierarchy is all well and good
and covers every possible use case,
but sometimes you just wanna say "just print stuff to stdout pls",
and you wish that configuring the simplest thing was a little easier.].

Here's pretty much the simplest possible logging config
which just prints everything to the console (i.e. standard out).
I've added this code to the very end of the settings.py file.


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/settings.py (ch10l011)
====
[source,python]
----
LOGGING = {
    "version": 1,
    "disable_existing_loggers": False,
    "handlers": {
        "console": {"class": "logging.StreamHandler"},
    },
    "loggers": {
        "root": {"handlers": ["console"], "level": "INFO"},
    },
}
----
====

Rebuild and restart our container...

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    --mount type=bind,source="$PWD/src/db.sqlite3",target=/src/db.sqlite3 \
    -e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=sekrit \
    -e DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOST=localhost \
    -it superlists*
----

Then try the FT again (or submitting a new list item manually)
and we now should see a clear error message:

// TODO: test get from docker logs
[role="skipme"]
----
Internal Server Error: /lists/new
Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
  File "/src/lists/views.py", line 10, in new_list
    nulist = List.objects.create()
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  File "/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py",
  line 328, in execute
    return super().execute(query, params)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: lists_list
----

Re-create the database with `./src/manage.py migrate` and we'll be back to a working state.

Don't forget to commit our changes to _settings.py_ and _Dockerfile_,
and I think we can call it job done!
We've at least touched on many or most of the things you might need to think about
when considering production-readiness,
we've worked in small steps and used our tests all the way along,
and we're now ready to deploy our container to a real server!

Find out how, in our next exciting instalment...

TIP: Itamar Turner-Traurig has a great guide to
    https://pythonspeed.com/docker/[Docker Packaging for Python Developers],
    which I cannot recommend highly enough.
    Read that before you're too much older!

.Production-Readiness Config
*******************************************************************************

((("production-ready deployment", "best practices for")))
A few things to think about when trying to prepare a production-ready configuration:

Don't use the Django dev server in production::
  Something like Gunicorn or uWSGI is a better tool for running Django;
  it will let you run multiple workers, for example.
  ((("Gunicorn", "benefits of")))

Decide how to serve your static files::
  Static files aren't the same kind of things as the dynamic content
  that comes from Django and your webapp, so they need to be treated differently.
  WhiteNoise is just one example of how you might do that.

Check your settings.py for dev-only config::
  `DEBUG=True`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `SECRET_KEY` are the ones we came across,
  but you will probably have others
  (we'll see more when we start to send emails from the server).

Change things one at a time and rerun your tests frequently::
  Whenever we make a change to our server configuration,
  we can rerun the test suite,
  and either be confident that everything works as well as it did before,
  or find out immediately if we did something wrong.

Think about logging and observability::
  When things go wrong, you need to be able to find out what happened.
  At a minimum you need a way of getting logs and tracebacks out of your server,
  and in more advanced environments you'll want to think about metrics and tracing too.
  But we can't cover all that in this book!
