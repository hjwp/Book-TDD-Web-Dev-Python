== Making our App Production-Ready

Our container is working fine but it's not production-ready.
Let's try to get it there, using the tests to keep us safe.

In a way we're applying the Red-Green-Refactor cycle to our productionisation process.
Our hacky container config got us to Green, and now we're going to Refactor,
working incrementally (just as we would while coding),
trying to move from working state to working state,
and using the FTs to detect any regressions.

*******************************************************************************
As part of my work on the third edition of the book,
I'm making big changes to the deployment chapters,
and this is a very new draft.

This chapter is still very fresh,
but the content is all there,
so you should be able to follow along.

But as always I really, really need fedback.
So please hit me up at obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com, or via
https://github.com/hjwp/Book-TDD-Web-Dev-Python/issues[GitHub Issues]
and Pull Requests.

*******************************************************************************

=== What We Need to Do

What's wrong with our hacky container image?
A few things: first, we need to host our app on the "normal" port 80
so that people can access it using a regular URL.

Perhaps more importantly, we shouldn't use the Django dev server for production;
it's not designed for real-life workloads.
Instead, we'll use the popular Gunicorn Python/WSGI server.

((("DEBUG settings")))
In addition, several options in 'settings.py' are currently unacceptable.
`DEBUG=True`, is strongly recommended against for production,
we'll want to set a unique `SECRET_KEY`,
and as we'll see, other things will come up.

Let's go through and see if we can fix things one by one.



=== Switching to Gunicorn

((("production-ready deployment", "using Gunicorn", secondary-sortas="Gunicorn")))
((("Gunicorn", "switching to")))
Do you know why the Django mascot is a pony?
The story is that Django comes with so many things you want:
an ORM, all sorts of middleware, the admin site...
"What else do you want, a pony?" Well, Gunicorn stands for "Green Unicorn",
which I guess is what you'd want next if you already had a pony...

//001

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip install gunicorn*
Collecting gunicorn
[...]
Successfully installed gunicorn-21.2.0
$ *pip freeze | grep -i gunicorn== >> requirements.txt*
----

Gunicorn will need to know a path to a WSGI server,
which is usually a function called `application`.
Django provides one in 'superlists/wsgi.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.Dockerfile (ch10l002)
====
[source,Dockerfile]
----
CMD gunicorn --bind :8888 superlists.wsgi:application
----
====

As in the previous chapter, we can use the `docker build && docker run`
pattern to try out our changes by rebuilding and rerunning our container:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  -v ./src/db.sqlite3:/src/db.sqlite3 \
  -it superlists*
----


==== The FTs catch a problem with static files

As we run the functional tests, you'll see them warning us of a problem, once again.
The test for adding list items passes happily,
but the test for layout + styling fails. Good job, tests!

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]
AssertionError: 102.5 != 512 within 10 delta (409.5 difference)
FAILED (failures=1)
----

And indeed, if you take a look at the site, you'll find the CSS is all broken,
as in <<site-with-broken-css>>.

The reason that we have no CSS is that although the Django dev server will
serve static files magically for you, Gunicorn doesn't.


[[site-with-broken-css]]
.Broken CSS
image::images/twp2_1001.png["The site is up, but CSS is broken"]


One step forward, one step backward,
but once again we've identified the problem nice and early.
Moving on!


=== Serving Static Files with Whitenoise

Serving static files is very different from serving
dynamically rendered content from Python and Django.
There are many ways to serve them in production:
you can use a web server like Nginx, or a CDN like Amazon S3,
but in our case, the most straightforward thing to do
is to use https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/[Whitenoise],
a Python library expressly designed for serving staticfootnote:[
Believe it or not, this pun didn't actually hit me until I was rewriting this chapter.
For 10 years it was right under my nose. I think that makes it funnier actually.]
files from Python.

Let's install it first:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip install whitenoise*
$ *pip freeze | grep -i whitenoise== >> requirements.txt*
----

Then we tell Django to enable it:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/settings.py (ch10l003)
====
[source,python]
----
MIDDLEWARE = [
    "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
    "whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware",
    "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
    [...]

----
====

And if you take another manual look at your site, things should look much healthier.
Let's rerun our FTs to confirm:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python manage.py test functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]

...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 10.718s

OK
----

Phew.  Let's commit that

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git commit -am"Switch to Gunicorn and Whitenoise"*
----


=== Using Environment Variables to Adjust Settings for Production

((("DEBUG settings")))
We know there are several things in
_settings.py_ that we want to change for production:


* `DEBUG` mode is all very well for hacking about on your own server,
  but it https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#debug[isn't secure].
  For example, exposing raw tracebacks to the world is a bad idea.

* `SECRET_KEY` is used by Django for some of its crypto--things
  like cookies and CSRF protection.
  It's good practice to make sure the secret key in production is different
  from the one in your source code repo,
  because that code might be visible to strangers.
  We'll want to generate a new, random one
  but then keep it the same for the foreseeable future
  (find out more in the https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/signing/[Django docs]).

Development, staging and production sites always have some differences
in their configuration.
Environment variables are a good place to store those different settings.
See http://www.clearlytech.com/2014/01/04/12-factor-apps-plain-english/[
"The 12-Factor App"].footnote:[
Another common way of handling this
is to have different versions of _settings.py_ for dev and prod.
That can work fine too, but it can get confusing to manage.
Environment variables also have the advantage of working for non-Django stuff too...
]


==== Setting DEBUG=True and SECRET_KEY

There's lots of ways you might do this.
Here's what I propose; it may seem a little fiddly,
but I'll provide a little justification for each choice.
Let them be an inspiration (but not a template) for your own choices!


[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch10l005)
====
[source,python]
----
import os
[...]

if "DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE" in os.environ:  #<1>
    DEBUG = False
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ["DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"]  #<2>
else:
    DEBUG = True  #<3>
    SECRET_KEY = "insecure-key-for-dev"
----
====

<1> We say we'll use an environment variable called `DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE`
    to switch debug mode off, and in effect require production settings
    (it doesn't matter what we set it to, just that it's there).

<2> And now we say that, if debug mode is off,
    we _require_ the `SECRET_KEY` to be set by a second environment variable.

<3> Otherwise we fall-back to the insecure, debug mode settings that
    are useful for Dev.

The end result is that you don't need to set any env vars for dev,
but production needs both to be set explicitly,
and it will error if any are missing.
I think this gives us a little bit of protection
against accidentally forgetting to set one.

TIP: Better to fail hard than allow a typo in an environment variable name to
    leave you running with insecure settings.

==== Setting environment variables inside the Dockerfile

Now let's set that environment variable in our Dockerfile using then `ENV` directive:

[role="sourcecode"]
.Dockerfile (ch10l006)
====
[source,dockerfile]
----
WORKDIR /src

ENV DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE=1
CMD gunicorn --bind :8888 superlists.wsgi:application
----
====

And try it out...



[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:specialcharacters,quotes[*docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  -v ./src/db.sqlite3:/src/db.sqlite3 \
  -it superlists*]

[...]
  File "/src/superlists/settings.py", line 22, in <module>
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ["DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"]
                 ~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<frozen os>", line 685, in __getitem__
KeyError: 'DJANGO_SECRET_KEY'
----

Ooops, and I forgot to set said secret key env var,
mere seconds after having dreamt it up!


==== Setting Environment Variables at the Docker Command Line

We've said we can't keep the secret key in our source code,
so the Dockerfile isn't an option; where else can we put it?

For now, we can set it at the command line using the `-e` flag for `docker run`:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker build -t superlists . && docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  -v ./src/db.sqlite3:/src/db.sqlite3 \
  -e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=sekrit \
  -it superlists*
----

With that running, we can use our FT again to see if we're back to a working state.

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 ./manage.py test functional_tests --failfast*]
[...]
AssertionError: 'To-Do' not found in 'Bad Request (400)'
----



==== ALLOWED_HOSTS is Required When Debug Mode is Turned Off

Not quite!  Let's take a look manually: <<django-400-error>>.

[[django-400-error]]
.An ugly 400 error
image::images/twp2_1002.png["An unfriendly page showing 400 Bad Request"]

We've set our two environment variables but doing so seems to have broken things.
But once again, by running our FTs frequently,
we're able to identify the problem early,
before we've changed too many things at the same time.
We've only changed two settings—which one might be at fault?

Let's use the "Googling the error message" technique again,
with the search terms "django debug false" and "400 bad request".

Well, the very first link in my https://duckduckgo.com/?q=django+400+bad+request[search results]
was Stackoverflow suggesting that a 400 error is usually to do with `ALLOWED_HOSTS`,
and the second was the official Django docs,
which takes a bit more scrolling, but confirms it
(see <<search-results-400-bad-request>>).

[[search-results-400-bad-request]]
.Search results for "django debug false 400 bad request"
image::images/search-results-400-bad-request.png["Duckduckgo search results with stackoverflow and django docs"]


`ALLOWED_HOSTS` is a security setting
designed to reject requests that are likely to be forged, broken or malicious
because they don't appear to be asking for your site
(HTTP request contain the address they were intended for in a header called "Host").

By default, when DEBUG=True, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` effectively allows _localhost_,
our own machine, so that's why it was working OK until now.

There's more information in the
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts[Django docs].

The upshot is that we need to adjust `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in _settings.py_.
Let's use another environment variable for that:


[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch10l007)
====
[source,python]
----
if "DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE" in os.environ:
    DEBUG = False
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ["DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"]
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = [os.environ["DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOST"]]
else:
    DEBUG = True
    SECRET_KEY = "insecure-key-for-dev"
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = []
----
====

This is a setting that we want to change,
depending on whether our docker image is running locally,
or on a server, so we'll use the `-e` flag again:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *docker build -t superlists . && \
    docker run -p 8888:8888 -v ./src/db.sqlite3:/src/db.sqlite3 \
        -e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=sekrit \
        -e DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOST=localhost \
        -it superlists*
----


==== Collectstatic is Required when Debug is Turned Off

An FT run (or just looking at the site) reveals that we've had a regression
in our static files.

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]
AssertionError: 102.5 != 512 within 10 delta (409.5 difference)
FAILED (failures=1)
----


We saw this before when switching from the Django dev server to Gunicorn,
so we introduced Whitenoise.
Similarly, when we switch DEBUG off,
Whitenoise stops automagically finding static files in our code,
and instead we need to run `collectstatic`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.Dockerfile (ch10l008)
====
[source,dockerfile]
----
WORKDIR /src

RUN python manage.py collectstatic

ENV DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE=1
CMD gunicorn --bind :8888 superlists.wsgi:application
----
====

Well, it was fiddly, but that should get us to passing tests!


[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=localhost:8888 python manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]
OK
----

We have a container that we're ready to ship to production!

Find out how in the next exciting installment...


////
=== TODO: log files

provoke a 500 error somehow and make sure we see tracebacks for it?

docker logs might be enough.
alternatively, mount logfiles from host.

.Production-Readiness Config
*******************************************************************************

((("production-ready deployment", "best practices for")))
A few things to think about when trying to prepare a production-ready configuration:

Don't use the Django dev server in production::
  Something like Gunicorn or uWSGI is a better tool for running Django;
  it will let you run multiple workers, for example.
  ((("Gunicorn", "benefits of")))

Decide how to serve your static files::
  Static files aren't the same kind of things as the dynamic content
  that comes from Django and your webapp, so they need to be treated differently.
  WhiteNoise is just one example of how you might do that.

Check your settings.py for dev-only config::
  `DEBUG=True`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `SECRET_KEY` are the ones we came across,
  but you will probably have others
  (we'll see more when we start to send emails from the server).

Change things one at a time and rerun your tests frequently::
  Whenever we make a change to our server configuration,
  we can rerun the test suite,
  and either be confident that everything works as well as it did before,
  or find out immediately if we did something wrong.
