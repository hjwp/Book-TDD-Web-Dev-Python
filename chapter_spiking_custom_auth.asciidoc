User Authentication, Spiking, and [keep-together]#De-Spiking#
-------------------------------------------------------------



((("authentication", id="Adespike18")))Our
beautiful lists site has been live for a few days, and our users are
starting to come back to us with feedback.  "We love the site", they say, "but
we keep losing our lists.  Manually remembering URLs is hard. It'd be great if
it could remember what lists we'd started".

Remember Henry Ford and faster horses. Whenever you hear a user requirement,
it's important to dig a little deeper and think--what is the real requirement
here?  And how can I make it involve a cool new technology I've been wanting
to try out?

Clearly the requirement here is that people want to have some kind of user
account on the site.  So, without further ado, let's dive into authentication.

((("passwords")))Naturally
we're not going to mess about with remembering passwords
ourselves--besides being 'so' '90s, secure storage of user passwords is a
security nightmare we'd rather leave to someone else.  We'll use something
fun called passwordless auth instead.

(If you 'insist' on storing your own passwords, Django's default auth
module is ready and waiting for you. It's nice and straightforward, and I'll
leave it to you to discover on your own.)


[role="pagebreak-before less_space"]
Passwordless Auth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



((("authentication", "passwordless")))((("Oauth")))((("Openid")))What
authentication system could we use to avoid storing passwords ourselves?
Oauth?  Openid?  "Login with Facebook"?   Ugh.  For me those all have
unacceptable creepy overtones; why should Google or Facebook know what sites
you're logging into and when?

In the first edition I used an experimental project called "Persona",
cooked up by a some of the wonderful techno-hippy-idealists at Mozilla, but
sadly that project was abandoned.

Instead I've found a fun approach to authentication that goes by the name
of "Passwordless", but you might call it "just use email".

The system was invented by someone annoyed at having to create
new passwords for so many websites, who found himself just using random,
throwaway passwords, not even trying to remember them, and using the
"forgot my password" feature whenever he needed to log in again. You can
https://medium.com/@ninjudd/passwords-are-obsolete-9ed56d483eb#.cx8iber30[read
all about it on Medium].

The concept is:  just use email to verify someone's identity.  If you're
going to have a "forgot my password" feature, then you're trusting email
anyway, so why not just go the whole hog?  Whenever someone wants to log in,
we generate a unique URL for them to use, email it to them, and they then
click through that to get into the site.

It's by no means a perfect system, and in fact there are lots of subtleties
to be thought through before it would really make a good login solution for
a production website, but this is just a fun toy project so let's give it a go.



Exploratory Coding, aka "Spiking"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TODO: I have copied this paragraph into <<chapter_16_javascript>> so it's now
a duplicate.


((("exploratory coding", see="also spiking and de-spiking")))((("spiking and de-spiking", "defined")))((("prototyping", see="spiking and de-spiking")))Before
I wrote this chapter all I knew about passwordless auth was the outline
I'd read in the article linked above.  I'd never seen any code for it, and didn't really know where
to start in building it.

In pass:[Chapters <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_13_database_layer_validation" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber">#chapter_13_database_layer_validation</a> and <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_14_simple_form" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber">#chapter_14_simple_form</a>] we saw that you
can use a unit test as a way of exploring a new API or tool, but sometimes you
just want to hack something together without any
tests at all, just to see if it works, to learn it or get a feel for it.
That's absolutely fine.  When learning a new tool or exploring a new possible
solution, it's often appropriate to leave the rigorous TDD process to one side,
and build a little prototype without tests, or perhaps with very few tests.
The goat doesn't mind looking the other way for a bit.

This kind of prototyping activity is often called a "spike", for 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/249969/why-are-tdd-spikes-called-spikes[reasons
best known].

((("django-allauth")))((("python-social-auth")))The
first thing I did was take a look at existing Python and Django authentication
packages, like http://www.intenct.nl/projects/django-allauth/[django-allauth]
and https://github.com/omab/python-social-auth[python-social-auth], but both of
them looked overcomplicated for this stage (and besides, it'll be more fun to
code our own!).

So instead I dived in and hacked about, and after a few dead ends and wrong turns,
I had something which just about works.  I'll take you on a tour, and then
we'll go through and "de-spike" the implementation—that is, replace the prototype
with tested, production-ready code.  

You should go ahead and add this code to your own site too, and then you can
have a play with it, try logging in with your own email address, and convince
yourself that it really does work.



Starting a Branch for the Spike
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("spiking and de-spiking", "branching your VCS")))((("Git", "creating branches")))Before
embarking on a spike, it's a good idea to start a new branch, so you
can still use your VCS without worrying about your spike commits getting mixed
up with your production code:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git checkout -b passwordless-spike*
----

Let's keep track of some of the things we're hoping to learn from the
spike:

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* 'How to send emails'
* 'Generating and recognising unique tokens'
* 'How to authenticate someone in Django'
* 'What steps will the user have to go through?'
*****


Frontend Log in UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


((("authentication", "frontend log in UI")))Let's
start with the frontend, hacking in an actual form to be able to
enter your email address into the navbar, and a logout link for
users who are already authenticated:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch16l001)
====
[source,html]
----
<body>
  <div class="container">

    <div class="navbar">
      {% if user.is_authenticated %}
        <p>Logged in as {{ user.email }}</p>
        <p><a id="id_logout" href="{% url 'logout' %}">Log out</a></p>
      {% else %}
        <form method="POST" action ="{% url 'send_login_email' %}">
          Enter email to log in: <input name="email" type="text" />
          {% csrf_token %}
        </form>
      {% endif %}
    </div>

    <div class="row">
    [...]
----
====


Sending Emails from Django
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("authentication", "sending emails from Django", id="SDemail18")))((("Django framework", "sending emails", id="DFemail18")))((("send_mail function", id="sendmail18")))((("emails, sending from Django", id="emails18")))The
login theory will be something like this:

- When someone wants to log in, we generate a unique secret token for them,
    store it in the database linked to their email, and send it to them.

- They then check their email, which will have a link to a URL that includes 
    that token.

- When they click that link, we check whether the token exists in database,
    and if so, they are logged in as the associated user.





First we prep an app for our accounts stuff:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py startapp accounts*
----

And we'll wire up 'urls.py' with at least one URL.  In the top-level 'superlists/urls.py'...

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/urls.py (ch16l003)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.conf.urls import include, url
from lists import views as list_views
from lists import urls as list_urls
from accounts import urls as accounts_urls

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', list_views.home_page, name='home'),
    url(r'^lists/', include(list_urls)),
    url(r'^accounts/', include(accounts_urls)),
]
----
====

And in the accounts module's 'urls.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/urls.py (ch16l004)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.conf.urls import url
from accounts import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^send_email$', views.send_login_email, name='send_login_email'),
]
----
====

Here's the view that's in charge of creating a token associated with the email
address the user puts in our login form:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/views.py (ch16l005)
====
[source,python]
----
import uuid
import sys
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.core.mail import send_mail

from accounts.models import Token


def send_login_email(request):
    email = request.POST['email']
    uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
    Token.objects.create(email=email, uid=uid)
    print('saving uid', uid, 'for email', email, file=sys.stderr)
    url = request.build_absolute_uri(f'/accounts/login?uid={uid}')
    send_mail(
        'Your login link for Superlists',
        f'Use this link to log in:\n\n{url}',
        'noreply@superlists',
        [email],
    )
    return render(request, 'login_email_sent.html')
----
====


For that to work we'll need a placeholder message confirming the email was
sent:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/templates/login_email_sent.html (ch16l006)
====
[source,html]
----
<html>
<h1>Email sent</h1>

<p>Check your email, you'll find a message with a link that will log you into
the site.</p>

</html>
----
====

(You can see how hacky this code is—we'd want to integrate this template
with our 'base.html' in the real version.)

More importantly, for the Django `send_mail` function to work, we need to tell
Django our email server address.  I'm just using my
Gmailfootnote:[Didn't I just spend a whole intro banging on about the privacy
implications of using Google for login, only to go on and use Gmail?  Yes,
it's a contradiction (honest, I will move off Gmail one day!). But in this
case I'm just using it for testing,  and the important thing is that I'm not
forcing Google on my users.]
account for now.  You can use any email provider you like, as long as they
support SMTP:

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch16l007)
====
[source,python]
----
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_PASSWORD')
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
----
====


TIP: ((("Gmail")))If
you want to use Gmail as well, you'll probably have to visit your
    Google account security settings page.  If you're using two-factor auth,
    you'll want to set up an 
    https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords[app-specific password].
    If you're not, you will probably still need to 
    https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps[allow access
    for less secure apps]. You might want to consider creating a new Google
    account for this purpose, rather than using one containing sensitive data.((("", startref="emails18")))((("", startref="sendmail18")))((("", startref="DFemail18")))((("", startref="SDemail18"))) 


Another Secret, Another Environment Variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("authentication", "avoiding secrets in source code")))((("environment variables")))Once
again, we have a "secret" that we want to avoid keeping directly in
our source code or on GitHub, so another environment variable gets
used in the `os.environ.get`.

To get this to work, we need to set it in the shell that's running my dev
server:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *export EMAIL_PASSWORD="sekrit"*
----

Later we'll see about adding that to the _.env_ on the staging server as well.


Storing Tokens in the Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("authentication", "storing tokens in databases")))((("tokens")))How
are we doing?

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#How to send emails#'
* 'Generating and recognising unique tokens'
* 'How to authenticate someone in Django'
* 'What steps will the user have to go through?'
*****

We'll need a model to store our tokens in the database—they link an
email address with a unique ID.  Pretty simple:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/models.py (ch16l008)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.db import models

class Token(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()
    uid = models.CharField(max_length=255)
----
====


Custom Authentication Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("authentication", "custom authentication models")))While
we're messing about with models, let's start experimenting with
authentication in Django.

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#How to send emails#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Generating# and recognising unique tokens'
* 'How to authenticate someone in Django'...
* 'What steps will the user have to go through?'
*****

The first thing we'll need is a user model.
When I first wrote this, custom user models were a new thing in
Django, so I dived into the 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/auth/customizing/[Django 
auth documentation] and tried to hack in the simplest possible one:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/models.py (ch16l009)
====
[source,python]
----
[...]
from django.contrib.auth.models import (
    AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager, PermissionsMixin
)


class ListUser(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField(primary_key=True)
    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    #REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['email', 'height']

    objects = ListUserManager()

    @property
    def is_staff(self):
        return self.email == 'harry.percival@example.com'

    @property
    def is_active(self):
        return True
----
====

//TODO: consider removing the commented-out REQUIRED_FIELDS

That's what I call a minimal user model!  One field, none of this
firstname/lastname/username nonsense, and, pointedly, no password! 
Somebody else's problem!

But, again, you can see that this code isn't ready
for production, from the commented-out lines to the hardcoded harry
email address.  We'll neaten this up quite a lot when we de-spike.


To get it to work, you need a model manager for the user:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.accounts/models.py (ch16l010)
====
[source,python]
----
[...]
class ListUserManager(BaseUserManager):

    def create_user(self, email):
        ListUser.objects.create(email=email)

    def create_superuser(self, email, password):
        self.create_user(email)
----
====


No need to worry about what a model manager is at this stage;
for now we just need it because we need it, and it just works.  When we
de-spike, we'll examine each bit of code that actually ends up in production
and make sure we understand it fully.


Finishing the Custom Django Auth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("authentication", "custom Django authentication", id="SDcustom18")))Almost
there—our last step combines recognising the token and then actually logging the user in.  Once we've done this,
we'll be able to pretty much strike off all the items on 
our scratchpad:

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#How to send emails#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Generating# and recognising unique tokens'
* 'How to authenticate someone in Django'
* 'What steps will the user have to go through?'
*****

So here's the view that actually handles the click through from the link in the
email:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.accounts/views.py (ch16l011)
====
[source,python]
----
import uuid
import sys
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate
from django.contrib.auth import login as auth_login
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.shortcuts import redirect, render
[...]

def login(request):
    print('login view', file=sys.stderr)
    uid = request.GET.get('uid')
    user = authenticate(uid=uid)
    if user is not None:
        auth_login(request, user)
    return redirect('/')
----
====


The "authenticate" function invokes Django's authentication framework, which
we configure using a "custom authentication backend",
whose job it is to validate the UID and return a user with the right email.

We could have done this stuff directly in the view, but we may as well
structure things the way Django expects.  It makes for a reasonably neat
separation of concerns:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/authentication.py (ch16l012)
====
[source,python]
----
import sys
from accounts.models import ListUser, Token

class PasswordlessAuthenticationBackend(object):

    def authenticate(self, uid):
        print('uid', uid, file=sys.stderr)
        if not Token.objects.filter(uid=uid).exists():
            print('no token found', file=sys.stderr)
            return None
        token = Token.objects.get(uid=uid)
        print('got token', file=sys.stderr)
        try:
            user = ListUser.objects.get(email=token.email)
            print('got user', file=sys.stderr)
            return user
        except ListUser.DoesNotExist:
            print('new user', file=sys.stderr)
            return ListUser.objects.create(email=token.email)


    def get_user(self, email):
        return ListUser.objects.get(email=email)
----
====


Again, lots of debug prints in there, and some duplicated code, not something
we'd want in production, but it works...


Finally, a logout view:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/views.py (ch16l013)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.contrib.auth import login as auth_login, logout as auth_logout
[...]

def logout(request):
    auth_logout(request)
    return redirect('/')
----
====


Add login and logout to our _urls.py_...

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/urls.py (ch16l014)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.conf.urls import url
from accounts import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^send_email$', views.send_login_email, name='send_login_email'),
    url(r'^login$', views.login, name='login'),
    url(r'^logout$', views.logout, name='logout'),
]
----
====

[role="pagebreak-before"]
Almost there! We switch on the auth backend and our new accounts app in
'settings.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch16l015)
====
[source,python]
----
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    #'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'lists',
    'accounts',
]

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.ListUser'
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'accounts.authentication.PasswordlessAuthenticationBackend',
]

MIDDLEWARE = [
[...]
----
====

A quick `makemigrations` to make the token and user models real:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'accounts':
  accounts/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model ListUser
    - Create model Token
----


And a `migrate` to build the database:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py migrate*
[...]
Running migrations:
  Applying accounts.0001_initial... OK
----


And we should be all done! Why not spin up a dev server with `runserver` and
see how it all looks (<<spike-login-worked>>)?

[[spike-login-worked]]
.It works! It works! Mwahahahaha.
image::images/twp2_1801.png["successful login"]

TIP: If you get an `SMTPSenderRefused` error message, don't forget to set
    the `EMAIL_PASSWORD` environment variable in the shell that's running
    `runserver`.


That's pretty much it! Along the way, I had to fight pretty hard, including
clicking around the Gmail account security UI for a while, stumbling over
several missing attributes on my custom user model (because I didn't read the
docs properly), and even at one point switching to the dev version of Django to
overcome a bug, which thankfully turned out to be irrelevant.((("", startref="SDcustom18")))



[role="pagebreak-before less_space"]
.Aside: Logging to stderr
*******************************************************************************

((("stderr")))((("logging")))((("spiking and de-spiking", "logging to stderr")))While
spiking, it's pretty critical to be able to see exceptions that are being
generated by your code. Annoyingly, Django doesn't send all exceptions to the 
terminal by default, but you can make it do so with a variable called `LOGGING`
in 'settings.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch16l017)
====
[source,python]
----
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
        },
    },
    'root': {'level': 'INFO'},
}
----
====

Django uses the rather "enterprisey" logging package from the Python standard
library, which, although very fully featured, does suffer from a fairly steep
learning curve. It's covered a little more in <<chapter_server_side_debugging>>,
and in the https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/logging/[Django docs].
*******************************************************************************

But we now have a working solution!  Let's commit it on our spike branch:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status*
$ *git add accounts*
$ *git commit -am "spiked in custom passwordless auth backend"*
----

Time to de-spike!



De-spiking
~~~~~~~~~~

((("spiking and de-spiking", "de-spiking", id="SDde18")))De-spiking means
rewriting your prototype code using TDD.  We now have enough information to "do
it properly".  So what's the first step?  An FT, of course!

We'll stay on the spike branch for now, to see our FT pass against our spiked
code.  Then we'll go back to master and commit just the FT.

Here's a first, simple version of the FT:

[role="pagebreak-before"]
<1> Were you worried about how we were going to handle retrieving emails in our
    tests?  Thankfully we can cheat for now! When running tests, Django gives
    us access to any emails the server tries to send via the `mail.outbox`
    attribute. We'll save checking "real" emails for later (but we will do it!).


And if we run the FT, it works!

The first thing it wants us to do is add an email input element. Bootstrap has
some built-in classes for navigation bars, so we'll use them, and include a
form for the login email:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch16l020)
====
[source,html]
----
<div class="container">

  <nav class="navbar navbar-default" role="navigation">
    <div class="container-fluid">
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">Superlists</a>
      <form class="navbar-form navbar-right" method="POST" action="#">
        <span>Enter email to log in:</span>
        <input class="form-control" name="email" type="text" />
        {% csrf_token %}
      </form>
    </div>
  </nav>

  <div class="row">
  [...]
----
====
//ch16l018


Now our FT fails because the login form doesn't actually do anything:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test functional_tests.test_login*]
[...]
AssertionError: 'Check your email' not found in 'Superlists\nEnter email to log
in:\nStart a new To-Do list'
----

NOTE: I recommend reintroducing the `LOGGING` setting from earlier at this 
    point.  There's no need for an explicit test for it; our current test
    suite will let us know in the unlikely event that it breaks anything. As
    we'll find out in <<chapter_server_side_debugging>>, it'll be useful for
    debugging later.


Time to start writing some Django code. We begin by creating an app called
`accounts` to hold all the files related to login:

[role="dofirst-ch16l021-1"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py startapp accounts*
----
//21-2

You could even do a commit just for that, to be able to distinguish the
placeholder app files from our modifications.

Next let's rebuild our minimal user model, with tests this time, and see
if it turns out neater than it did in the spike.((("", startref="SDde18")))



A Minimal Custom User Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



((("authentication", "minimal custom user model", id="SDminimal18")))Django's
built-in user model makes all sorts of assumptions about what
information you want to track about users, from explicitly recording
first name and last 
namefootnote:[A decision which you'll find prominent Django maintainers saying
they now regret.  Not everyone has a first name and a last name.]
to forcing you to use a username.   I'm a great believer in not storing
information about users unless you absolutely must, so a user model that
records an email address and nothing else sounds good to me!

By now I'm sure you can manage to create the tests folder and its pass:[<em>__init__.py</em>],
remove _tests.py_, and then add a __test_models.py__ to say:

[role="sourcecode dofirst-ch16l022"]
.accounts/tests/test_models.py (ch16l024)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.test import TestCase
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

User = get_user_model()


class UserModelTest(TestCase):

    def test_user_is_valid_with_email_only(self):
        user = User(email='a@b.com')
        user.full_clean()  # should not raise
----
====
//24


That gives us an expected failure:

[role="dofirst-ch16l023"]
----
django.core.exceptions.ValidationError: {'password': ['This field cannot be
blank.'], 'username': ['This field cannot be blank.']}
----

Password?  Username?  Bah!  How about this?


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/models.py
====
[source,python]
----
from django.db import models

class User(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()
----
====
//25


And we wire it up inside 'settings.py', adding `accounts` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
and a variable called `AUTH_USER_MODEL`: 

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch16l026)
====
[source,python]
----
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    #'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'lists',
    'accounts',
]

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.User'

----
====


The next error is a database error:

----
django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: accounts_user
----

That prompts us, as usual, to do a migration... When we try, Django complains
that our custom user model is missing a couple of bits of metadata:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py makemigrations*]
Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
    if not isinstance(cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS, (list, tuple)):
AttributeError: type object 'User' has no attribute 'REQUIRED_FIELDS'
----


Sigh.  Come on, Django, it's only got one field, so you should be able to figure
out the answers to these questions for yourself.  Here you go:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/models.py
====
[source,python]
----
class User(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []
----
====

Next silly question?footnote:[You might ask, if I think Django is so silly, why
don't I submit a pull request to fix it?  Should be quite a simple fix.  Well,
I promise I will, as soon as I've finished writing the book.  For now, snarky
comments will have to suffice.]

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py makemigrations*]
[...]
AttributeError: type object 'User' has no attribute 'USERNAME_FIELD'
----

And we go through a few more of these, until we get to:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/models.py
====
[source,python]
----
class User(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()

    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []
    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    is_anonymous = False
    is_authenticated = True
----
====


And now we get a slightly different error:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py makemigrations*]
SystemCheckError: System check identified some issues:

ERRORS:
accounts.User: (auth.E003) 'User.email' must be unique because it is named as
the 'USERNAME_FIELD'.
----

Well, the simple way to fix that would be like this:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/models.py (ch16l028-1)
====
[source,python]
----
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
----
====

Now the migration is successful:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'accounts':
  accounts/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model User
----

And the test passes:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py test accounts*
[...]
Ran 1 tests in 0.001s
OK
----


But our model isn't quite as simple as it could be.  It has the email field,
and also an autogenerated "ID" field as its primary key.  We could make it
even simpler!


Tests as Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




((("tests as documentation")))((("documentation")))Let's
go all the way and make the email field into the primary
key,footnote:[Emails may not be the perfect primary key IRL. One reader, clearly
deeply emotionally scarred, wrote me a tearful email about how much they've
suffered for over a decade from trying to deal with the effects of email primary
keys, due to their making multiuser account management impossible. So, as
ever, YMMV.]
and thus implicitly remove the autogenerated `id` column.

Although we could just do it and our test would still pass, and conceivably
claim it was "just a refactor", it would be better to have a specific test:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/tests/test_models.py (ch16l028-3)
====
[source,python]
----
    def test_email_is_primary_key(self):
        user = User(email='a@b.com')
        self.assertEqual(user.pk, 'a@b.com')
----
====

It'll help us remember if we ever come back and look at the code again
in future:

----
    self.assertEqual(user.pk, 'a@b.com')
AssertionError: None != 'a@b.com'
----

NOTE: Your tests can be a form of documentation for your code--they express
    what your requirements are of a particular class or function. Sometimes, if
    you forget why you've done something a particular way, going back and
    looking at the tests will give you the answer.  That's why it's important
    to give your tests explicit, verbose method names.

And here's the implementation (feel free to check what happens with
`unique=True` first):

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/models.py (ch16l028-4)
====
[source,python]
----
    email = models.EmailField(primary_key=True)
----
====


And we mustn't forget to adjust our migrations:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*rm accounts/migrations/0001_initial.py*]
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'accounts':
  accounts/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model User
----
//029




((("", startref="SDminimal18")))And
both our tests pass:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test accounts*]
[...]
Ran 2 tests in 0.001s
OK
----



A Token Model to Link Emails with a Unique ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("authentication", "token model to link emails", id="SDtoken18")))Next
let's build a token model.  Here's a short unit test
that captures the essence—you should be able to link an
email to a unique ID, and that ID shouldn't be the same two
times in a row:

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/tests/test_models.py (ch16l030)
====
[source,python]
----
from accounts.models import Token
[...]


class TokenModelTest(TestCase):

    def test_links_user_with_auto_generated_uid(self):
        token1 = Token.objects.create(email='a@b.com')
        token2 = Token.objects.create(email='a@b.com')
        self.assertNotEqual(token1.uid, token2.uid)
----
====

I won't show every single listing for creating the
Token class in 'models.py'; I'll let you do that yourself
instead. Driving Django models with basic TDD involves jumping
through a few hoops because of the migration, so you'll
see a few iterations like this—minimal code change,
make migrations, get new error, delete migrations, 
re-create new migrations, another code change, and so on...



[role="dofirst-ch16l031"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'accounts':
  accounts/migrations/0002_token.py
    - Create model Token
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test accounts*]
[...]
TypeError: 'email' is an invalid keyword argument for this function
----

I'll trust you to go through these conscientiously—remember, 
I may not be able to see you, but the Testing Goat can!



[role="dofirst-ch16l032"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*rm accounts/migrations/0002_token.py*]
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'accounts':
  accounts/migrations/0002_token.py
    - Create model Token
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test accounts*]
AttributeError: 'Token' object has no attribute 'uid'
----


Eventually you should get to this code...

[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/models.py (ch16l033)
====
[source,python]
----
class Token(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()
    uid = models.CharField(max_length=40)
----
====

And this error:

[role="dofirst-ch16l034"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test accounts*]
[...]

    self.assertNotEqual(token1.uid, token2.uid)
AssertionError: '' == ''
----

And here we have to decide how to generate our random unique ID field.  We
could use the `random` module, but Python actually comes with another module
specifically designed for generating unique IDs called "uuid" (for "universally
unique id").

We can use that like this:


[role="sourcecode"]
.accounts/models.py (ch16l035)
====
[source,python]
----
import uuid
[...]

class Token(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()
    uid = models.CharField(default=uuid.uuid4, max_length=40)
----
====


And, with a bit more wrangling of migrations, that should get us to passing
tests:


[role="dofirst-ch16l036"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py test accounts*
[...]
Ran 3 tests in 0.015s

OK
----



Well,  that gets us on our way!  The models layer is done, at least.
In the next chapter, we'll get into mocking, a key technique for testing
external dependencies like email.((("", startref="SDtoken18")))

.Exploratory Coding, Spiking, and De-spiking
****
Spiking::
    ((("spiking and de-spiking", "defined")))Exploratory
coding to find out about a new API, or to explore the
    feasibility   of a new solution.  Spiking can be done without tests.  It's
    a good idea to do your spike on a new branch, and go back to master when
    de-spiking.
    

De-spiking::
    Taking the work from a spike and making it part of the production codebase.
    The idea is to throw away the old spike code altogether, and start again
    from scratch, using TDD once again. De-spiked code can often come out
    looking quite different from the original spike, and usually much nicer.


Writing your FT against spiked code::
    ((("functional tests (FTs)", "spiked code and")))Whether
or not this is a good idea depends on your circumstances.  The
    reason it can be useful is because it can help you write the FT
    correctly--figuring out how to test your spike can be just as challenging
    as the spike itself.  On the other hand, it might constrain you towards
    reimplementing a very similar solution to your spiked one--something to
    watch out for.((("", startref="Adespike18")))
