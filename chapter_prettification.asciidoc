== Prettification: Layout and Styling, and What to Test About It

((("layout", see="CSS; design and layout testing")))
((("style", see="CSS; design and layout testing")))
We're starting to think about releasing the first version of our site,
but we're a bit embarrassed by how ugly it looks at the moment.
In this chapter, we'll cover some of the basics of styling,
including integrating an HTML/CSS framework called Bootstrap.
We'll learn how static files work in Django,
and what we need to do about testing them.



=== Testing Layout and Style

((("design and layout testing", "selecting test targets", id="DLTtargets08")))
Our site is undeniably a bit unattractive at the moment
(<<homepage-looking-ugly>>).


NOTE: If you spin up your dev server with `manage.py runserver`,
    you may run into a database error
    "table lists_item has no column named list_id".
    You need to update your local database
    to reflect the changes we made in 'models.py'.
    Use `manage.py migrate`.
    If it gives you any grief about `IntegrityErrors`,
    just delete the database filefootnote:[
    What? Delete the database?  Are you crazy?  Not completely.
    The local dev database often gets out of sync with its migrations as we
    go back and forth in our development, and it doesn't have any important
    data in it, so it's OK to blow it away now and again.  We'll be much more
    careful once we have a "production" database on the server.  More on this
    in <<data-migrations-appendix>>.]
    and try again.

We can't be adding to Python's reputation for being
http://grokcode.com/746/dear-python-why-are-you-so-ugly/[ugly],
so let's do a tiny bit of polishing.
Here's a few things we might want:

* A nice large input field for adding new and existing lists
* A large, attention-grabbing, centered box to put it in

((("aesthetics, testing", seealso="design and layout testing")))
How do we apply TDD to these things?
JMost people will tell you you shouldn't test aesthetics, and they're right.
It's a bit like testing a constant, in that tests usually wouldn't add any value.


[[homepage-looking-ugly]]
.Our home page, looking a little ugly...
image::images/twp2_0801.png["Our home page, looking a little ugly."]


((("static files", "challenges of")))
((("CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)", "challenges of static files")))
But we can test the behaviour of our aesthetics, ie, that we have any at all.
Essentially, we want to reassure ourselves that things are working.
For example, we're going to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for our styling,
and they are loaded as static files.
Static files can be a bit tricky to configure
(especially, as we'll see later, when you move off your own computer and onto a hosting site),
so we'll want some kind of simple "smoke test" that the CSS has loaded.
We don't have to test fonts and colours and every single pixel,
but we can do a quick check that the main input box is aligned the way we want it on each page,
and that will give us confidence that the rest of the styling for that page is probably loaded too.

Let's add a new test method inside our functional test:

[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py (ch08l001)
====
[source,python]
----
class NewVisitorTest(LiveServerTestCase):
    [...]


    def test_layout_and_styling(self):
        # Edith goes to the home page,
        self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)

        # Her browser window is set to a very specific size
        self.browser.set_window_size(1024, 768)

        # She notices the input box is nicely centered
        inputbox = self.browser.find_element(By.ID, "id_new_item")
        self.assertAlmostEqual(
            inputbox.location["x"] + inputbox.size["width"] / 2,
            512,
            delta=10,
        )
----
====

A few new things here.
We start by setting the window size to a fixed size.
We then find the input element,
look at its size and location,
and do a little maths
to check whether it seems to be positioned in the middle of the page.
`assertAlmostEqual` helps us to deal with rounding errors
and the occasional weirdness due to scrollbars and the like,
by letting us specify that we want our arithmetic to work
to within plus or minus 10 pixels.

If we run the functional tests, we get:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]
.F.
======================================================================
FAIL: test_layout_and_styling (functional_tests.tests.NewVisitorTest)

Traceback (most recent call last):

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 9.188s

FAILED (failures=1)
----

That's the expected failure.
Still, this kind of FT is easy to get wrong,
so let's use a quick-and-dirty "cheat" solution,
to check that the FT definitely passes when the input box is centered.
We'll delete this code again almost as soon as we've used it
to check the FT:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.lists/templates/home.html (ch08l002)
====
[source,html]
----
<form method="POST" action="/lists/new">
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <input name="item_text" id="id_new_item" placeholder="Enter a to-do item" />
  </p>
  {% csrf_token %}
</form>
----
====

That passes, which means the FT works.
Let's extend it to make sure that the input box is also
center-aligned on the page for a new list:

[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py (ch08l003)
====
[source,python]
----
    # She starts a new list and sees the input is nicely
    # centered there too
    inputbox.send_keys("testing")
    inputbox.send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
    self.wait_for_row_in_list_table("1: testing")
    inputbox = self.browser.find_element(By.ID, "id_new_item")
    self.assertAlmostEqual(
        inputbox.location["x"] + inputbox.size["width"] / 2,
        512,
        delta=10,
    )
----
====

That gives us another test failure:

----
  File "...goat-book/functional_tests/tests.py", line 141, in

----

Let's commit just the FT:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git add functional_tests/tests.py*
$ *git commit -m "first steps of FT for layout + styling"*
----

Now it feels like we're justified in finding a "proper" solution
to our need for some better styling for our site.
We can back out our hacky `text-align: center`:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----

=== Prettification: Using a CSS Framework

((("design and layout testing", "CSS frameworks", id="DLTcssframe08")))
((("CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)", "CSS frameworks", id="CSSframe08")))
((("Bootstrap", "downloading")))
UI design is hard, and doubly so
now that we have to deal with mobile, tablets, and so forth.
That's why many programmers, particularly lazy ones like me,
turn to CSS frameworks to solve some of those problems for them.
There are lots of frameworks out there,
but one of the earliest and most popular still, is Twitter's Bootstrap.
Let's use that.

You can find bootstrap at http://getbootstrap.com/.

We'll download it and put it in a new folder called 'static' inside the `lists`
app:footnote:[On Windows, you may not have `wget` and `unzip`, but I'm sure you
can figure out how to download Bootstrap, unzip it, and put the contents of the
'dist' folder into the 'lists/static/bootstrap' folder.]

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *wget -O bootstrap.zip https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v5.3.0/bootstrap-5.3.0-dist.zip*
$ *unzip bootstrap.zip*
$ *mkdir lists/static*
$ *mv bootstrap-5.3.0-dist lists/static/bootstrap*
$ *rm bootstrap.zip*
----
//ch08l005

Bootstrap comes with a plain, uncustomised installation in the 'dist' folder.
We're going to use that for now,
but you should really never do this for a real site--vanilla
Bootstrap is instantly recognisable,
and a big signal to anyone in the know that you couldn't be bothered to style your site.
Learn how to use LESS and change the font, if nothing else!
There is info in Bootstrap's docs, or there's an
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-customize-bootstrap-with-sass/
[introductory guide here].


Our 'lists' folder will end up looking like this:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]

$ pass:[<strong>tree lists</strong>]

│   └── list.html
├── [...]
----

((("Bootstrap", "documentation")))
Look at the "Getting Started" section of the
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/ [Bootstrap documentation];
you'll see it wants our HTML template to include something like this:


[role="skipme"]
[source,html]
----
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Bootstrap demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

----

We already have two HTML templates.
We don't want to be adding a whole load of boilerplate code to each,
so now feels like the right time to apply
the "Don't repeat yourself" rule,
and bring all the common parts together.
Thankfully, the Django template language makes that easy using something
called template inheritance.
((("", startref="DLTcssframe08")))
((("", startref="CSSframe08")))





=== Django Template Inheritance

((("design and layout testing", "Django template inheritance")))
((("templates", "Django template inheritance")))
((("Django framework", "template inheritance")))
Let's have a little review of what the differences are between 'home.html' and
'list.html':

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*diff lists/templates/home.html lists/templates/list.html*]
<     <h1>Start a new To-Do list</h1>
<     <form method="POST" action="/lists/new">
---
>     <h1>Your To-Do list</h1>
>     <form method="POST" action="/lists/{{ list.id }}/add_item">
[...]
>     <table id="id_list_table">
>       {% for item in list.item_set.all %}
>         <tr><td>{{ forloop.counter }}: {{ item.text }}</td></tr>
>       {% endfor %}
>     </table>
----

They have different header texts, and their forms use different URLs. On top
of that, 'list.html' has the additional `<table>` element.

//IDEA add a note re downsides of inheritance?
Now that we're clear on what's in common and what's not, we can make the two
templates inherit from a common "superclass" template.  We'll start by
making a copy of 'list.html':

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *cp lists/templates/list.html lists/templates/base.html*
----
//006

We make this into a base template which just contains the common boilerplate,
and mark out the "blocks", places where child templates can customise it:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch08l006)
====
[source,html]
----
<html>
  <head>
    <title>To-Do lists</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>{% block header_text %}{% endblock %}</h1>

    <form method="POST" action="{% block form_action %}{% endblock %}">
      <input name="item_text" id="id_new_item" placeholder="Enter a to-do item" />
      {% csrf_token %}
    </form>

    {% block table %}
    {% endblock %}
  </body>

</html>
----
====

The base template defines a series of areas called "blocks",
which will be places that other templates can hook in and add their own content.
Let's see how that works in practice,
by changing 'home.html' so that it "inherits from" 'base.html':

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html (ch08l007)
====
[source,html]
----
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header_text %}Start a new To-Do list{% endblock %}

{% block form_action %}/lists/new{% endblock %}
----
====

You can see that lots of the boilerplate HTML disappears,
and we just concentrate on the bits we want to customise.
We do the same for 'list.html':

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/list.html (ch08l008)
====
[source,html]
----
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header_text %}Your To-Do list{% endblock %}

{% block form_action %}/lists/{{ list.id }}/add_item{% endblock %}

{% block table %}
  <table id="id_list_table">
    {% for item in list.item_set.all %}
      <tr><td>{{ forloop.counter }}: {{ item.text }}</td></tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </table>
{% endblock %}
----
====


That's a refactor of the way our templates work.
We rerun the FTs to make sure we haven't broken anything...

----
AssertionError: 117.0 != 512 within 10 delta (395.0 difference)
----

Sure enough, they're still getting to exactly where they were before.
That's worthy of a commit:
((("Git", "diff -w")))

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff -w*
# the -w means ignore whitespace, useful since we've changed some html indenting
$ *git status*
$ *git add lists/templates* # leave static, for now
$ *git commit -m "refactor templates to use a base template"*
----



=== Integrating Bootstrap

((("design and layout testing", "Bootstrap integration")))
((("Bootstrap", "integrating")))
Now it's much easier to integrate the boilerplate code that Bootstrap wants--we
won't add the JavaScript yet, just the CSS:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch08l009)
====
[source,html]
----
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

  <head>
    <title>To-Do lists</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
[...]
----
====


==== Rows and Columns

Finally, let's actually use some of the Bootstrap magic!
You'll have to read the documentation yourself,
but we should be able to use a combination
of the grid system and the `justify-content-center` class to get what we want:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch08l010)
====
[source,html]
----
  <body>
    <div class="container">

      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">
          <h1 class="display-1">{% block header_text %}{% endblock %}</h1>

          <form class="mb-2" method="POST" action="{% block form_action %}{% endblock %}" >
            <input
              class="form-control"
              name="item_text"
              id="id_new_item"
              placeholder="Enter a to-do item"
            />
            {% csrf_token %}
          </form>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          {% block table %}
          {% endblock %}
        </div>
      </div>

    </div>
  </body>
----
====
// ch08l007

(If you've never seen an HTML tag broken up over several lines, that `<input>`
may be a little shocking. It is definitely valid, but you don't have to use
it if you find it offensive. ;)

We also need to add the `.table` class to our table in _list.html_:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch08l010)
====
[source,html]
----
  <table class="table" id="id_list_table">
----
====


TIP: Take the time to browse through the
    http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap documentation],
    if you've never seen it before.
    It's a shopping trolley brimming full of useful tools to use in your site.

Does that work?

----
AssertionError: 117.0 != 512 within 10 delta (395.0 difference)
----

Hmm. No.  Why isn't our CSS loading?



=== Static Files in Django

((("Django framework", "static files in", id="DJFstatic08")))
Django, and indeed any web server, needs to know two things to deal with static files:

1. How to tell when a URL request is for a static file, as opposed to for some
   HTML that's going to be served via a view function

2. Where to find the static file the user wants

In other words, static files are a mapping from URLs to files on disk.

((("static files", "URL requests for")))
For item 1, Django lets us define a URL "prefix" to say that
any URLs which start with that prefix should be treated as requests for static files.
By default, the prefix is [keep-together]#'/static/'#. It's defined in 'settings.py':


[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.superlists/settings.py
====
[source,python]
----
[...]

# Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/static-files/

STATIC_URL = '/static/'
----
====

((("static files", "finding")))
The rest of the settings we will add to this section are all to do with item 2:
finding the actual static files on disk.

While we're using the Django development server (`manage.py runserver`),
we can rely on Django to magically find static files for us--it'll
just look in any subfolder of one of our apps called 'static'.

You now see why we put all the Bootstrap static files into 'lists/static'.
So why are they not working at the moment?
It's because we're not using the `/static/` URL prefix.
Have another look at the link to the CSS in 'base.html':

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.lists/templates/base.html
[source,html]
----
    <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
----

[role="pagebreak-before"]
To get this to work, we need to change it to:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch08l012)
====
[source,html]
----
    <link href="/static/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
----
====


When `runserver` sees the request, it knows that it's for a static file because
it begins with `/static/`.  It then tries to find a file called
_bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css_, looking in each of our app folders for
subfolders called 'static', and it should find it at
'lists/static/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css'.

So if you take a look manually, you should see it works, as in
<<list-page-centered>>.

[[list-page-centered]]
.Our site starts to look a little better...
image::images/prettified.png["The list page with centered header."]



Switching to StaticLiveServerTestCase
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



((("StaticLiveServerTestCase")))If
you run the FT though, it won't pass:

----
AssertionError: 117.0 != 512 within 10 delta (395.0 difference)
----

That's because, although `runserver` automagically finds static files,
`LiveServerTestCase` doesn't.  Never fear, though: the Django developers have
made a more magical test class called `StaticLiveServerTestCase` (see
http://bit.ly/Suv4Ip[the
docs]).

Let's switch to that:

[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py
====
[source,diff]

    connection was forcibly closed by the remote host`.  Add a

Hooray!


Using Bootstrap Components to Improve the Look of the Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("design and layout testing", "Bootstrap tools")))Let's
see if we can do even better, using some of the other tools in
Bootstrap's panoply.


Jumbotron!
^^^^^^^^^^



((("jumbotron class (Bootstrap)")))((("Bootstrap", "jumbotron class")))Bootstrap
has a class called `jumbotron` for things that are meant to be
particularly prominent on the page.  Let's use that to embiggen the main
page header and the input form:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch08l009)
====
[source,html]
----
    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 jumbotron">
      <div class="text-center">
        <h1>{% block header_text %}{% endblock %}</h1>
        <form method="POST" action="{% block form_action %}{% endblock %}">
          [...]
----
====

TIP: When hacking about with design and layout, it's best to have a window open
    that we can hit refresh on, frequently.  Use `python manage.py runserver`
    to spin up the dev server, and then browse to pass:[<em>http://localhost:8000</em>] to
    see your work as we go.


//IDEA: screenshot here?

Large Inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^



((("Bootstrap", "large inputs")))((("form control classes (Bootstrap)")))The
jumbotron is a good start, but now the input box has tiny text compared to
everything else.  Thankfully, Bootstrap's form control classes offer an option
to set an input to be "large":


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch08l010)
====
[source,html]
----
    <input name="item_text" id="id_new_item"
           class="form-control input-lg"
           placeholder="Enter a to-do item" />
----
====


Table Styling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^





((("Bootstrap", "table styling")))((("table styling (Bootstrap)")))The
table text also looks too small compared to the rest of the page now.
Adding the Bootstrap `table` class improves things:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/list.html (ch08l011)
====
[source,html]
----
  <table id="id_list_table" class="table">
----
====



Using Our Own CSS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



((("design and layout testing", "CSS creation and application")))((("CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)", "creation and application")))Finally
I'd like to just offset the input from the title text slightly. There's
no ready-made fix for that in Bootstrap, so we'll make one ourselves.  That
will require specifying our own CSS file:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html
====
[source,html]
----
  [...]
    <title>To-Do lists</title>
    <link href="/static/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="/static/base.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
----
====

We create a new file at 'lists/static/base.css', with our new CSS rule.
We'll use the `id` of the input element, `id_new_item`, to find it and give it
some styling:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/base.css
====
[source,html]
----
#id_new_item {
    margin-top: 2ex;
}
----
====

All that took me a few goes, but I'm reasonably happy with it now
(<<homepage-looking-better>>).

If you want to go further with customising Bootstrap, you need to get into
compiling LESS. I 'definitely' recommend taking the time to do that some
day. LESS and other pseudo-CSS-alikes like Sass are a great improvement on
plain old CSS, and a useful tool even if you don't use Bootstrap. I won't cover
it in this book, but you can find resources on the internets.
http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/12/customizing-bootstrap/[Here's one],

A last run of the functional tests, to see if everything still works OK:

What We Glossed Over: collectstatic and Other Static Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~





((("design and layout testing", "collecting static files for deployment", id="DLTcollect08")))((("static files", "collecting for deployment", id="SFcollect08")))((("collectstatic command", id="collect08")))We
saw earlier that the Django dev server will magically find all your static
files inside app folders, and serve them for you. That's fine during
development, but when you're running on a real web server, you don't want
Django serving your static content--using Python to serve raw files is
slow and inefficient, and a web server like Apache or Nginx can do this all for
you. You might even decide to upload all your static files to a CDN, instead
of hosting them yourself.

For these reasons, you want to be able to gather up all your static files from
inside their various app folders, and copy them into a single location, ready
for deployment. This is what the `collectstatic` command is for.

The destination, the place where the collected static files go, is defined in
'settings.py' as `STATIC_ROOT`. In the next chapter we'll be doing some
deployment, so let's actually experiment with that now.  A common and
straightforward place to put it is in a folder called "static" in the root
of our repo:

[role="skipme"]
----
.
├── db.sqlite3
├── functional_tests/
├── lists/
├── manage.py
├── static/
└── superlists/
----

[role="pagebreak-before"]
Here's a neat way of specifying that folder, making it relative to the location
of the project base directory:

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch08l018)
====
[source,python]
----
# Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/static-files/

STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
----
====


Take a look at the top of the settings file, and you'll see how that `BASE_DIR`
variable is helpfully defined for us, using `__file__` (which itself is a
really, really useful Python built-infootnote:[
Notice in the `os.path` wrangling of `BASE_DIR` that the `abspath` gets done
first (i.e., innermost).  Always follow this pattern when chaining `os.path`
operations, otherwise you can see unpredictable behaviours depending on how the
file is imported.  Thanks to https://github.com/CleanCut/green[Green Nathan]
for that tip!]).


Anyway, let's try running `collectstatic`:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py collectstatic*]
[...]
Copying '...goat-book/lists/static/bootstrap/css/bootstrap-theme.css'
Copying '...goat-book/lists/static/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css'

76 static files copied to '...goat-book/static'.
----

And if we look in './static', we'll find all our CSS files:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *tree static/*
static/
├── admin
│   ├── css
│   │   ├── base.css
[...]
│               └── xregexp.min.js
├── base.css
└── bootstrap
    ├── css
    │   ├── bootstrap.css
    │   ├── [...]
    │   └── bootstrap-theme.min.css
    ├── fonts
    │   ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot
    │   ├── [...]
    │   └── glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff2
    └── js
        ├── bootstrap.js
        ├── bootstrap.min.js
        └── npm.js


14 directories, 76 files
----

`collectstatic` has also picked up all the CSS for the admin site. It's one of
Django's powerful features, and we'll find out all about it one day, but we're
not ready to use that yet, so let's disable it for now:

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py
====
[source,python]
----
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    #'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'lists',
]
----
====

[role="pagebreak-before"]
And we try again:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*rm -rf static/*]
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py collectstatic --noinput*]
Copying '...goat-book/lists/static/base.css'
[...]
Copying '...goat-book/lists/static/bootstrap/css/bootstrap-theme.css'
Copying '...goat-book/lists/static/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css'


15 static files copied to '...goat-book/static'.
----

Much better.



Now we know how to collect all the static files into a single folder,
where it's easy for a web server to find them. We'll find out all about that,
including how to test it, in the next chapter!

((("", startref="DLTcollect08")))((("", startref="SFcollect08")))((("", startref="collect08")))For
now let's save our changes to 'settings.py'.  We'll also add the top-level
static folder to our gitignore, since it will only contain copies of files
we actually keep in individual apps' static folders.


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff* # should show changes in settings.py plus the new directory*
$ *echo /static >> .gitignore*
$ *git commit -am "set STATIC_ROOT in settings and disable admin"*
----


A Few Things That Didn't Make It
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inevitably this was only a whirlwind tour of styling and CSS, and there were
several topics that I'd considered covering that didn't make it.
Here are a few candidates for further study:

* Customising bootstrap with LESS or SASS
* The `{% static %}` template tag, for more DRY and fewer hardcoded URLs
* Client-side packaging tools, like `npm` and `bower`

.Recap: On Testing Design and Layout
*******************************************************************************

((("design and layout testing", "best practices for")))The
short answer is: you shouldn't write tests for design and layout 'per se'.
It's too much like testing a constant, and the tests you write are often
brittle.

With that said, the 'implementation' of design and layout involves something
quite tricky: CSS and static files.   As a result, it is valuable to have some
kind of minimal "smoke test" which checks that your static files and CSS are
working.  As we'll see in the next chapter, it can help pick up problems when
you deploy your code to [keep-together]#production#.

Similarly, if a particular piece of styling required a lot of client-side
JavaScript code to get it to work (dynamic resizing is one I've spent a bit
of time on), you'll definitely want some tests for that.

Try to write the minimal tests that will give you confidence that your design
and layout is working, without testing 'what' it actually is.  Aim to leave
yourself in a position where you can freely make changes to the design and
layout, without having to go back and adjust tests all the time.
