[appendix]
== Continuous Deployment (CD)

.Warning
*******************************************************************************
This appendix is just a placeholder / rough sketch.

It should have the outline of what you need to set up automated deploys tho!
Why not give it a try?

*******************************************************************************

((("continuous delivery (CD)")))
This is the next step after CI.
Once we have a server that automatically does things every time we push,
we can take the next step in automating our deploys,
and deploy our code to staging (and even production!)
with every push.

NOTE: "CD" sometimes stands for Continuous Deployment,
    when used to contrast with "CI",
    and sometimes it stands for "Continuous Delivery",
    which is basically a combination of CI and CD.
    Never forget, the purpose of acronyms
    is to differentiate insiders from outsiders,
    so the confusion _is_ the point.


* This is an appendix because we get even more tied in to the particularities
  of an individual platform

* It's also incredibly fiddly. the feedback cycle is annoying slow,
  and you have to commit and push with every small change.
  just look at my commit history!

Tricky!

Building and running a docker image can only be done on a `docker.git` image,
but we want `python:slim` to run our tests,
and to actually have Ansible installed

*idea 1:*

- build and push a docker image to gitlab registry after each ci run
- deploy to staging using the new image tag
- run tests against staging


*idea 2:*

- run tests inside docker  (needs an image with firefox tho)
- run fts inside docker against _another_ docker container
- deploy from inside docker


I've seen variants on both of these.  Gave idea 1 a go first,
and it worked out:


first (or, very quickly), i commented out the fts part of the tests.
one of the worst things about fiddling with ci is how slow it is to get feedback:



[role="sourcecode"]
..gitlab-ci.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
test:
  image: python:slim

  before_script:
    # TODO temporarily commented out
    # - apt update -y && apt install -y firefox-esr
    - python --version ; pip --version  # For debugging
    - pip install virtualenv
    - virtualenv .venv
    - source .venv/bin/activate

  script:
    [...]
----
====

recap:
1. run tests in python image (with firefox and our virtualenv / requirements.txt)
2. build docker image in a docker-in-docker image
3. deploy to staging (from the python image once again, needs ansible)
4. run fts against staging (from the python image, with firefox)

now, deploy playbook currently assumes we're building the docker image
as part of the deploy, but we can't do that because it happened on a different image

we could use cache / "build artifacts" to move the image around,
but we may as well do something that's more like real life.
you remember i said the `docker push / docker load` dance was a simulation
of `push+pull` from a "container registry"?  well let's do that.

1. run tests (python image)
2. build our image AND push to registry (docker image)
3. deploy to staging referencing our image in the registry (python image)
4. run fts against staging (python image, with firefox)

=== Building our docker image and pushing it to Gitlab registry

TODO: gitlab container registry screnshot


[role="sourcecode"]
..gitlab-ci.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
build:
  image: docker:git
  services:
    - docker:dind

  script:
    - docker build
      -t registry.gitlab.com/hjwp/book-example:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
      .
    - echo "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" | docker login $CI_REGISTRY -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER --password-stdin
    - docker push
      registry.gitlab.com/hjwp/book-example:$CI_COMMIT_SHA

link to gitlab registry docs, explain docker login, image tags.


=== Deploying from CI, working with secrets

[role="sourcecode"]
..gitlab-ci.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
deploy:
  stage: staging-deploy
  image: python:slim
  variables:
    ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING: "False"  # <1>

  before_script:
    - apt update -y && apt install -y
      curl
      openssh-client
    - python --version ; pip --version  # For debugging
    - pip install virtualenv
    - virtualenv .venv
    - source .venv/bin/activate

  script:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - pip install ansible
    # download secure files to get private key  # <2>
    - curl -s https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/download-secure-files/-/raw/main/installer | bash

      -vvv  # <3>
      ${PWD}/infra/deploy-playbook.yaml
----

<1> "known hosts" checking doesnt work well in ci
<2> we needed a way to give the ci server permission to access our server.
    I used a new ssh key
<3> super-verbose was necessary

TODO: explain generating ssh key, adding to `/home/elpseth/.ssh/authorized_keys` on server.


short listing, couple of hours of pain!

eg had to run thru about 200 lines of verbose logs to find this, 
and then a bit of web-searching, to figure out that known-hosts was the problem:

[role="skipme"]
----

debug1: read_passphrase: can't open /dev/tty: No such device or address

=== Updating deploy playbook to use the container registry:

We delete all the stages to do with building locally and uploading and re-importing:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.infra/deploy-playbook.yaml 
====
[source,diff]
----
@@ -19,37 +19,6 @@
     - name: Reset ssh connection to allow the user/group change to take effect
       ansible.builtin.meta: reset_connection

-    - name: Build container image locally
-    - name: Export container image locally
-    - name: Upload image to server
-    - name: Import container image on server
----
====

And instead, we can just use the full path to the image in our `docker run`
(with a login to the registry first):


[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.infra/deploy-playbook.yaml 
====
[source,yaml]
----
    - name: Login to gitlab container registry
      community.docker.docker_login:

        state: started
        recreate: true
        [...]
----
====

<1> just like in the ci script, we use the env vars to get the login details
<2> and we spell out the registry, with the commit sha, in the image name



=== Running Fts against staging

Add explicit "stages" to make things run in order:

[role="sourcecode"]
..gitlab-ci.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
stages:
  - build-and-test
  - staging-deploy
  - staging-test

test:
  image: python:slim
  stage: build-and-test

  [...]

build:
  image: docker:git
  services:
    - docker:dind
  stage: build-and-test

  script:
    [...]

test-staging:
  image: python:slim
  stage: staging-test
  [...]
----
====


And here's how we run the tests against staging:

[role="sourcecode"]
..gitlab-ci.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
test-staging:
  image: python:slim
  stage: staging-test

  before_script:
    - apt update -y && apt install -y
      curl
      firefox-esr  # <1>
      openssh-client
    - python --version ; pip --version  # For debugging
    - pip install virtualenv
    - virtualenv .venv
    - source .venv/bin/activate

  script:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - pip install selenium
    - curl -s https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/download-secure-files/-/raw/main/installer | bash
    - chmod 600 .secure_files/*  # <2>
    - env
      TEST_SERVER=staging.ottg.co.uk
      SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=.secure_files/keypair-for-gitlab  # <2>
      python src/manage.py test functional_tests

----
====

<1> we need firefox for the fts
<2> we needed the ssh key again, because as you might remember (i forgot!)
    the fts use ssh to talk to the db on the server,
    to manage the database.


So we need some changes in the base FT too:



[role="sourcecode"]
.lists.tests.py (ch04l004)
====
[source,python]
----

def _exec_in_container_on_server(host, commands):
    print(f"Running {commands!r} on {host} inside docker container")
    keyfile = os.environ.get("SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH")
    keyfile_arg = ["-i", keyfile, "-o", "StrictHostKeyChecking=no"] if keyfile else []  # <1><2>
    return _run_commands(
        ["ssh"]
        + keyfile_arg
        + [f"{USER}@{host}", "docker", "exec", "superlists"]
        + commands
    )
----
====


<1> `-i` tells ssh to use a specific private key
<2> `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` is how we disable known_hosts for the ssh client
    at the command-line



and that works

TODO it works deploy screenshot
