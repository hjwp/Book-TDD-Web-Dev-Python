== Getting a Server Ready for Deployment


((("infrastructure as code (IaC)")))
This chapter is all about getting ready for our deployment.
We're going to spin up an actual server,
make it accessible on the internet with a real domain name,
and set up the authentication and credentials we need
to be able to control it remotely with SSH and Ansible.

=== Manually Provisioning a Server to Host Our Site

((("staging sites", "manual server provisioning", id="SSserver09")))
((("server provisioning", id="seerver09")))
We can separate our "deployment" into two tasks:

. _Provisioning_ a new server to be able to host the code,
  which includes choosing an operating system,
  getting basic credentials to log in,
  and configuring DNS
. _Deploying_ our application to an existing server,
  which includes getting our Docker image onto the server,
  starting a container, and configuring it to talk to the database
  and the outside world

Infrastructure-as-code tools can let you automate both of these,
but the provisioning parts tend to be quite vendor-specific,
so for the purposes of this book, we can live with manual provisioning.

NOTE: I should probably stress once more that deployment is something that varies a lot
  and, as a result, there are few universal best practices for how to do it.
  So, rather than trying to remember the specifics of what I'm doing here,
  you should be trying to understand the rationale,
  so that you can apply the same kind of thinking in the specific future circumstances you encounter.


==== Choosing Where to Host Our Site

((("hosting services")))
There are loads of different solutions out there these days,
but they broadly fall into two camps:

. Running your own (probably virtual) server—aka VPS (virtual private server)
. Using a platform as a service (PaaS)
  offering like Heroku or my old employers, PythonAnywhere
  ((("platform-as-a-service (PaaS)")))((("VPS (virtual private server)")))
  ((("PythonAnywhere")))

With a PaaS, you don't get your own server;
instead, you're renting a "service" at a higher level of abstraction.
Particularly for small sites,
a PaaS offers many advantages over running your own server,
and I would definitely recommend looking into them.((("PaaS", see="platform-as-a-service")))
We're not going to use a PaaS in this book, however, for several reasons.
The main reason is that I want to avoid endorsing specific commercial providers.
Secondly, all the PaaS offerings are quite different,
and the procedures to deploy to each vary a lot--learning about one
doesn't necessarily tell you about the others.
Any one of them might radically change their process or business model by the time you get to read this book.

Instead, we'll learn just a tiny bit of good old-fashioned server admin,
including SSH and manual debugging.
They're unlikely to ever go away,
and knowing a bit about them will get you some respect
from all the grizzled dinosaurs out there.


==== Spinning Up Our Own Server

I'm not going to dictate how you spin up a server--whether
you choose Amazon AWS, Rackspace, DigitalOcean, your own server in a datacentre,
or a Raspberry Pi in a cupboard under the stairs,
any solution should((("server provisioning", "creating a server", id="ix_serprvcr")))((("Ubuntu", "server running Ubuntu 22.04"))) be fine, as long as:

* Your server is running Ubuntu 22.04 (aka "Jammy/LTS").

* You have root access to it.

* It's on the public internet (i.e., it has a public IP address).

* You can SSH into it (I recommend using a nonroot user account,
  with `sudo` access, and public/private key authentication).

I'm recommending Ubuntu as a distro because it's popular and I'm used to it.footnote:[Linux as an operating system comes in lots of different flavours,
called "distros" or "distributions".((("Linux", "different flavors or distributions")))
The differences between them and their relative pros and cons are,
like any seemingly minor detail, of tremendous interest to the right kind of nerd.
We don't need to care about them for this book. As I say, Ubuntu is fine.]
If you know what you're doing, you can probably get away with using
something else, but I won't be able to help you as much if you get stuck.


[[step-by-step-guide]]
.Step-by-Step Instructions for Spinning Up a Server
*******************************************************************************
((("server provisioning", "guide to")))((("Linux", "server, creating")))
I appreciate that, if you've never started a Linux server before
and you have absolutely no idea where to start,
this is a big ask, especially when I'm refusing to "dictate"
exactly how to do it.

With that in mind, I wrote a
https://github.com/hjwp/Book-TDD-Web-Dev-Python/blob/main/server-quickstart.md[very brief guide on GitHub]. I didn't want to include it in the book itself because,
inevitably, I do end up specifying a specific commercial provider in there.


*******************************************************************************

NOTE: Some people get to this chapter, and are tempted to skip the domain bit
    and the "getting a real server" bit, and just use a VM on their own PC.
    Don't do this.
    It's _not_ the same, and you'll have more difficulty following the instructions,
    which are complicated enough as it is.
    If you're worried about cost, have a look at the guide I wrote for free options.
    ((("getting help")))




.General Tip for Working with Infrastructure
*******************************************************************************

The most important lesson to remember over the next few chapters is,
as always but more than ever, to work incrementally,
make one change at a time, and run your tests frequently.((("infrastructure", "working with")))

When things (inevitably) go wrong, resist the temptation to flail about
and make other unrelated changes in the hope that things will start working again;
instead, stop, go backwards if necessary to get to a working state,
and figure out what went wrong before moving forwards again.

It's just as easy to fall into the Refactoring Cat trap when working with infrastructure!((("server provisioning", "creating a server", startref="ix_serprvcr")))

*******************************************************************************


=== Getting a Domain Name

((("domains", "getting a domain name")))
We're going to need a couple of domain names at this point in the book--they
can both be subdomains of a single domain.((("server provisioning", "getting a domain name")))
I'm going to use _superlists.ottg.co.uk_ and _staging.ottg.co.uk_.
If you don't already own a domain, this is the time to register one!
Again, this is something I really want you to _actually_ do.
If you've never registered a domain before,
just pick any old registrar and buy a cheap one--it
should only cost you $5 or so,
and I promise seeing your site on a "real" website will be a thrill.

// DAVID: just wondering if it's worth giving them the option to cheat and
// specify a domain name in a hosts file?



=== Configuring DNS for Staging and Live Domains

We don't want to be messing about with IP addresses all the time,
so we should point our staging and live domains to the server.((("domains", "configuring DNS for staging and live domains")))
At my registrar, the control screens looked a bit like <<registrar-control-screens>>.

[[registrar-control-screens]]
.Domain setup
image::images/tdd3_1101.png["Registrar control screen for adding a DNS record"]

((("A-records")))((("AAAA-records (IPv6)")))
In the DNS system, pointing a domain at a specific IP address is referred to as an "A-record".footnote:[
Strictly speaking, A-records are for IPv4,
and you can also use AAAA-records for IPv6.
Some cheap providers only support IPv6,
and there's nothing wrong with that.]
All registrars are slightly different,
but a bit of clicking around should get you to the right screen in yours.
You'll need two A-records:
one for the staging address and one for the live one.
No need to worry about any other type of record.

DNS records take some time to "propagate" around the world
(it's controlled by a setting called "TTL", time to live),
so once you've set up your A-record,
you can check its progress on a "propagation checking" service like this one:
https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/staging.ottg.co.uk.

I'm planning to host my staging server at _staging.ottg.co.uk_.


=== Ansible

Infrastructure-as-code tools, also called "configuration management" tools,
come in lots of shapes and sizes.((("Ansible")))((("deployment", "automating with Ansible", id="Dfarbric11")))((("infrastructure as code (IaC)", "tools for")))((("configuration management tools")))
Chef and Puppet were two of the original ones,
and you'll probably come across Terraform,
which is particularly strong on managing cloud services like AWS.

// SEBASTIAN: mentioning of too many technologies (e.g. Puppet/Chef - IMHO not necessary in 2024).

We're going to use the infrastructure automation tool Ansible—because it's relatively popular,
because it can do everything we need it to,
because I'm biased that it happens to be written in Python,
and because it's probably the one I'm personally most familiar with.

Another tool could probably have worked just as well!
The main thing to remember is the _concept_, which is that,
as much as possible we want to manage our server configuration _declaratively_,
by expressing the desired state of the server in a particular configuration syntax,
rather than specifying a procedural series of steps to be followed one by one.

==== Ansible Versus SSH: How We'll Talk to Our Server

<<ansible-and-ssh>> shows how we’ll interact with our server using SSH, Ansible, and our FTs.

[[ansible-and-ssh]]
.Ansible and SSH
image::images/tdd3_1102.png["Diagram "]

Our objective is to use Ansible((("Ansible", "using with SSH for server interactions", id="ix_AnsSSH")))((("SSH", "using with Ansible to interact with server"))) to automate the process of deploying to our server:
making sure that the server has everything it needs to run our app
(mostly, Docker and our container image),
and then telling it to start or restart our container.

Now and again, we'll want to "log on" to the server and have a look around manually;
for that, we'll use the `ssh` command line on our computer,
which can let us open up an interactive console on the server.

Finally, we'll run our FTs against the server, once it's running our app,
to make sure it's all working correctly.


=== Start by Making Sure We Can SSH In

At this point and for the rest of the book,
I'm assuming that you have a nonroot user account set up,
and that it has `sudo` privileges,
so whenever we need to do something that requires root access, we use `sudo`,
(or "become" in Ansible terminology);
I'll be explicit about that in the various instructions that follow.((("SSH", "making sure you can SSH to the server")))

My user is called "elspeth", but you can call yours whatever you like!
Just remember to substitute it in all the places I've hardcoded it.
See the guide I wrote (<<step-by-step-guide>>)
if you need tips on creating a `sudo` user.


Ansible uses SSH under the hood to talk to the server,
so checking we can log in "manually" is a good first step:


[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *ssh elspeth@staging.ottg.co.uk*
elspeth@server$: *echo "hello world"*
hello world
----


TIP: Look out for that `elspeth@server`
    in the command-line listings in this chapter.
    It indicates commands that must be run on the server,
    as opposed to commands you run on your own PC.


.Use WSL on Windows
*******************************************************************************
Ansible will not run natively on Windows (see the
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/intro_windows.html#using-windows-as-the-control-node[docs])
but you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL),
a sort of mini-Linux that Microsoft has made to run inside Windows.((("Ansible", "using WSL on Windws with")))((("Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)")))

Follow Microsoft's https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment[instructions for setting up WSL].

Once inside your WSL environment, you can navigate to your project directory
on the host Windows filesystem at _/mnt/c/Users/yourusername/Projects/superlists_, for example.

You'll need to use a different virtualenv for WSL:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
yourusername@wsl: *cd /mnt/c/Users/yourusername/Projects/superlists*
yourusername@wsl: *python -m venv .venv-wsl*
yourusername@wsl: *source .venv-wsl/bin/activate*
----

If you are using public key authentication,
it's probably simplest to generate a new SSH keypair,
and add it to __home/elspeth/.ssh/authorized_keys__ on the server:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
yourusername@wsl: *ssh-keygen*
[..]
yourusername@wsl: *cat ~/.ssh/*.pub*
# copy the public key to your clipboard,
----

I'd suggest you _only_ use WSL when you need to use Ansible.

The alternative is to switch your whole dev environment to WSL,
and move your source code in there,
but you might need to overcome a few hurdles around things like networking.

*******************************************************************************


==== Debugging Issues with SSH

Here's a few things to try if you ((("SSH", "debugging issues with", id="ix_SSHdbg")))can't SSH in.

===== Debugging network connectivity

First, check network connectivity:  can we even reach the server?((("network connectivity", "checking for staging server")))

[role="skipme"]
[subs="quotes"]
----
$ *ping staging.ottg.co.uk*

# if that doesn't work, try the IP address
$ *ping 193.184.215.14*  # or whatever your IP is

# also see if the domain name resolves
$ *nslookup staging.ottg.co.uk*
----

If the IP works and the domain name doesn't,
and/or if the `nslookup` doesn't work,
you should go check your DNS config at your registrar.
You may just need to wait!((("nslookup")))((("domains", "checking DNS using propagation checker")))
Try a DNS propagation checker like https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/staging.ottg.co.uk.


===== Debugging SSH auth issues

Next, let's try and debug any possible issues with authentication.((("authentication", "SSH, debugging issues with")))

First, your hosting provider might have the option to open
a console directly from within their web UI.
That's worth trying, and if there are any problems there,
then you probably need to restart your server,
or perhaps stop it and create a new one.

TIP: It's worth double-checking your IP address at this point,
    in your provider's server control panel pages.

Next, we can try debugging our SSH connection:

[role="skipme small-code"]
[subs="quotes"]
----
# try the -v flag which turn on verbose/debug output
$ *ssh -v elspeth@staging.ottg.uk*
OpenSSH_9.7p1, LibreSSL 3.3.6
debug1: Reading configuration data ~/.ssh/config
debug1: Reading configuration data ~/.colima/ssh_config
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 21: include /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/* matched no files
debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 54: Applying options for *
debug1: Authenticator provider $SSH_SK_PROVIDER did not resolve; disabling
debug1: Connecting to staging.ottg.uk port 22.
ssh: Could not resolve hostname staging.ottg.uk: nodename nor servname provided, or not 
known
# oops I made a typo!  it should be ottg.co.uk not ottg.uk
----

If that doesn't help, try switching to((("root user", "switching to in SSH debugging"))) the root user instead:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="quotes"]
----
$ *ssh -v root@staging.ottg.co.uk*
[...]
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey
debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
debug1: get_agent_identities: bound agent to hostkey
debug1: get_agent_identities: agent returned 1 keys
debug1: Will attempt key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ED25519 SHA256:gZLxb9zCuGVT1Dm8 [...]
debug1: Will attempt key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
debug1: Will attempt key: ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
debug1: Will attempt key: ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk
debug1: Will attempt key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk
debug1: Will attempt key: ~/.ssh/id_xmss
debug1: Will attempt key: ~/.ssh/id_dsa
debug1: Offering public key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 [...]
debug1: Server accepts key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 [...]
Authenticated to staging.ottg.co.uk ([165.232.110.81]:22) using "publickey".
----

That one actually worked! But in the verbose output,
you can watch to make sure it finds the right SSH keys,
for example.((("public/private key pairs", "SSH keys")))

TIP: If root works but your nonroot user doesn't,
    you may need to add your public key to
    `/home/yournonrootuser/.ssh/authorized_keys`.


If root doesn't work either,
you may need to add your public SSH key to your account settings page,
via your provider's web UI.
That may or may not take effect immediately;
you might need to delete your old server and create a new one.

Remember, that probably means a new IP address!


.Security
*******************************************************************************
A serious discussion of server security is beyond the scope of this book,
and I'd warn against running your own servers
without learning a good bit more about it.((("server provisioning", "learning more about server security")))
(One reason people choose to use a PaaS to host their code
is that it means slightly fewer security issues to worry about.)
If you'd like a place to start, here's as good a place as any:
https://blog.codelitt.com/my-first-10-minutes-on-a-server-primer-for-securing-ubuntu.

I can definitely recommend the eye-opening experience of installing
Fail2Ban and watching its logfiles to see just how quickly it picks up on
random drive-by attempts to brute force your SSH login.  The internet is a
wild place!
((("Ansible", "using with SSH for server interactions", startref="ix_AnsSSH")))((("SSH", "debugging issues with", startref="ix_SSHdbg")))((("security issues and settings", "server security")))
((("platform-as-a-service (PaaS)")))
*******************************************************************************



==== Installing Ansible

Assuming we can reliably SSH into the server,
it's time to install Ansible and make sure it can talk to our server as well.((("Ansible", "installing")))

Take a look at the
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[Ansible installation guide]
for all the various options,
but probably the simplest thing to do is to install Ansible into the virtualenv
on our local machine (Ansible doesn't need to be installed on the server):

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip install ansible*
# we also need the Docker SDK for the ansible/docker integration to work:
$ *pip install docker*
----

// TODO: consider introducing an explicit requirements.dev.txt here,
// with -r requirements.txt and put ansible, docker, and selenium in there.
// or, maybe get that in place in the previous chapter, keep this one shorter.


==== Checking Ansible Can Talk to Our Server

This is the last step in ensuring we're ready:
making sure Ansible can talk to our server.((("Ansible", "checking interactions with server", id="ix_Ansserint")))

At the core of Ansible is what's called a "playbook",
which describes what we want to happen on our server. Let's create one now.
It's probably a good idea to keep it in a folder of its own:

[subs="quotes"]
----
*mkdir infra*
----

And here's a minimal playbook whose job is just to "ping"
the server, to check we can talk to it.((("YAML (yet another markup language)")))
It's in a format called YAML (yet another markup language)
which, if you've never come across before,
you will soon develop a love-hate relationship for:footnote:[
The "love" part is that YAML is very easy to _read_ and scan through at a glance.
The "hate" part is that the actual syntax is surprisingly fiddly to get right:
the difference between lists and key/value maps is subtle
and I can never quite remember it, honestly.]


[role="sourcecode"]
.infra/deploy-playbook.yaml (ch11l001)
====
[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ping to make sure we can talk to our server
      ansible.builtin.ping:
----
====


We won't worry too much about the syntax or how it works at the moment;
let's just use it to make sure everything works.

To invoke Ansible, we use the command `ansible-playbook`,
which will have been installed into your virutalenv when we did
the `pip install ansible` earlier.

Here's the full command we'll use, with an explanation of each part:

[role="small-code skipme"]
----
ansible-playbook \
  --user=elspeth \ <1>
  -i staging.ottg.co.uk, \ <2><3>
  infra/deploy-playbook.yaml \ <4>
  -vv <5>
----

<1> The `--user=` flag lets us specify the user to use to authenticate
    with the server.  This should be the same user you can SSH with.

<2> The `-i` flag specifies what server to run against.

<3> Note the trailing comma after the server hostname.
    Without this, it won't work
    (it's there because Ansible is designed to work against multiple servers
    at the same time).footnote:[
    The "i" in the `-i` flag stands for "inventory".
    Using the `-i` flag is actually a little unconventional.
    If you read the Ansible docs, you'll find they usually
    recommend having an "inventory file", which lists all your servers,
    along with various bits of qualifying metadata.
    That's overkill for our use case though!]

<4> Next comes the path to our playbook, as a positional argument.

<5> Finally the `-v` or `-vv` flags control how verbose the output will be—useful for debugging!


Here's some example output when I run it:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]

Looking good!
In the next chapter, we'll use Ansible to get our app up and running
on our server.  It'll be a thrill, I promise!((("Ansible", "checking interactions with server", startref="ix_Ansserint")))((("server provisioning", "recap of")))

.Server Prep Recap
*******************************************************************************

VPS versus PaaS::
  We discussed the trade-offs of running your own server versus opting for a PaaS.
  A VPS is great for learning, but you might find the lower admin overhead
  of a PaaS makes sense for real projects.((("platform-as-a-service (PaaS)", "VPS versus")))((("VPS (virtual private server)", "versus PaaS", secondary-sortas="PaaS")))

Domain name registration and DNS::
  This tends to be something you((("domains", "domain name registration and DNS"))) only do once,
  but buying a domain name and pointing it at your server
  is an unavoidable part of hosting a web app.
  Now you know your TTLs from your A-records!

SSH::
  SSH is the Swiss Army knife of server admin.((("SSH")))
  The dream is that everything is automated,
  but now and again you just gotta open up a shell on that box!

Ansible::
  Ansible will be our deployment automation tool.((("Ansible")))
  We've had the barest of teasers,
  but we have it installed and we're ready to learn how to use it.
