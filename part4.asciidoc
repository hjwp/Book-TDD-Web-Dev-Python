"Oh my gosh, what?  Another section?  Harry, I'm exhausted. It's already 
been four hundred pages; I don't think I can handle a whole nother section
of the book.  Particularly not if it's called 'Advanced&rsquo;...maybe I can
get away with just skipping it?"

Oh no, you can't! This may be called the "advanced" section,
but it's full of really important topics for test-driven development (TDD) and web development.
No way can you skip it.
If anything, it's 'even more important' than the first two sections.

First off, we'll get into that sine qua non of web development: JavaScript.
Seeing how TDD works in another language can give you a whole new perspective.

We'll be talking about a key technique, "spiking",
which is where you relax the strict rules of TDD
and allow yourself a bit of exploratory hacking.

TIP: A common objection to TDD is "how can I write tests if I don't even know what I'm doing?"
  Spiking is the bit where you get to play around and figure things out,
  so you can come back and do it test-first later.

We'll be talking about how to integrate third-party systems, and how to test them. We'll cover mocking, which is hard to avoid in the world of Python testing.footnote:[Although not impossible! Check out the book https://www.cosmicpython.com[_Cosmic Python_], which has tips on testing without mocks. I happen to know that at least one of the two authors is incredibly wise.]

We'll talk about text fixtures and server-side debugging, and how to set up a continuous integration (CI) environment.
None of these things are take-it-or-leave-it, optional, luxury extras for your project--they're all
vital!


Inevitably, the learning curve does get a little steeper in this section.
You may find yourself having to read things a couple of times before they sink in,
or you may find that things don't work on the first go,
and that you need to do a bit of debugging on your own.

But I encourage you to persist with it!
The harder it is, the more rewarding it is, right?
And, remember, I'm always happy to help if you're stuck;

Come on; I promise the best is yet to come!
