== More Advanced Forms

Let's look at some more advanced forms usage.
We’ve successfully helped our users to avoid blank list items, so now let’s help them to avoid duplicate items as well.

Our validation constraint so far has been about preventing blank items,
and as you may remember, it turned out that we can enforce that very easily in the frontend.
Avoiding duplicate items, however, is less straightforward to do in the frontend
(although not impossible, of course),
so this chapter will lean more heavily on server-side validation,
and bubbling errors from the backend back up to the UI.

This chapter goes into the more intricate details of Django's forms framework,
so you have my official permission to skim through it
if you already know all about customising Django forms and how to display errors in the UI,
or if you're reading this book for the TDD rather than for the Django.

If you're still learning Django, there's good stuff in here!
If you want to just skim-read, that's OK too.
Make sure you take a quick look at
<<testing-for-silliness>>,
and <<what-to-test-in-views>> at the end.

=== Another FT for Duplicate Items

((("form data validation", "for duplicate items", id="FDVduplicate15")))
((("functional tests (FTs)", "for duplicate items", secondary-sortas="duplicate items", id="FTduplicate15")))
((("duplicate items testing", "functional test for", id="DITfunctional15")))
((("user interactions", "preventing duplicate items", id="UIduplicate15")))
We add a second test method to `ItemValidationTest`,
and tell a little story about what we want to see happen
when a user tries to enter the same item twice into their to-do list:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/functional_tests/test_list_item_validation.py (ch16l001)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_cannot_add_duplicate_items(self):
    # Edith goes to the home page and starts a new list
    self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys("Buy wellies")
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
    self.wait_for_row_in_list_table("1: Buy wellies")

    # She accidentally tries to enter a duplicate item
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys("Buy wellies")
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys(Keys.ENTER)

    # She sees a helpful error message
    self.wait_for(
        lambda: self.assertEqual(
            self.browser.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".invalid-feedback").text,
            "You've already got this in your list",
        )
    )
----
====

Why use two test methods instead of extending one,
or instead of creating a new file and class?
It's a judgement call. These two feel closely related;
they're both about validation on the same input field,
so it feels right to keep them in the same file.
On the other hand, they're logically separate enough
that it's practical to keep them in different methods:

// DAVID: This feels a bit hand-wavy. What are we weighing up here?
// For example, does 'signal' matter in functional tests?
// How about speed?

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test functional_tests.test_list_item_validation*]

----

// DAVID: Side note: The favicon 404s are getting pretty distracting by this point, I wonder if it would be
// worth fixing / silencing that somehow earlier in the book?
// HARRY: could do it like this https://stackoverflow.com/a/38917888

OK, so we know the first of the two tests passes now.
Is there a way to run just the failing one, I hear you ask?
Why, yes indeed:

==== Preventing Duplicates at the Model Layer

((("model-layer validation", "preventing duplicate items")))
So, if we want to start to implement our actual objective for the chapter,
let's write a new test that checks that duplicate items in the same list raise an error:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_models.py (ch16l002)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_duplicate_items_are_invalid(self):
    mylist = List.objects.create()
    Item.objects.create(list=mylist, text="bla")
    with self.assertRaises(ValidationError):
        item = Item(list=mylist, text="bla")
        item.full_clean()
----
====

And, while it occurs to us,
we add another test to make sure we don't overdo it on our integrity constraints:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_models.py (ch16l003)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_CAN_save_same_item_to_different_lists(self):
    list1 = List.objects.create()
    list2 = List.objects.create()
    Item.objects.create(list=list1, text="bla")
    item = Item(list=list2, text="bla")
    item.full_clean()  # should not raise
----
====

I always like to put a little comment for tests that are checking
that a particular use case should _not_ raise an error; otherwise,
it can be hard to see what's being tested:

----
AssertionError: ValidationError not raised
----

If we want to get it deliberately wrong, we can do this:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/models.py (ch16l004)
====
[source,python]
----
class Item(models.Model):
    text = models.TextField(default="", unique=True)
    list = models.ForeignKey(List, default=None, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
----
====

[role="pagebreak-before"]
That lets us check that our second test really does pick up on this
problem:

----
ERROR: test_CAN_save_same_item_to_different_lists (lists.tests.test_models.List
AndItemModelsTest.test_CAN_save_same_item_to_different_lists)

----


[[testing-for-silliness]]
.An Aside on When to Test for Developer Silliness
*******************************************************************************

// TODO: i kinda want to back to "stupidity".  talk to Rita about it.

One of the judgement calls in testing is when you should write tests that sound
like "check that we haven't done something weird".  ((("developer silliness, when to test for")))In general, you should
be wary of these.


In this case, we've written a test to check that you can't save duplicate items
to the same list.  Now, the simplest way to get that test to pass, the way in
which you'd write the fewest lines of code, would be to make it impossible to
save 'any' duplicate items.  That justifies writing another test, despite the
fact that it would be a "silly" or "wrong" thing for us to code.

But you can't be writing tests for every possible way we could have coded
something wrong.footnote:[With that said, you can come pretty close.
Once you get comfortable writing tests manually, take a look at
https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io[Hypothesis].
It lets you automatically generate input for your tests,
covering many more test scenarios than you could realistically type manually.
It's not always easy to see how to use it,
but for the right kind of problem, it can be very powerful;
the very first time I used it, it found a bug!]
If you have a function that adds two numbers,
you can write a couple of tests:

[role="skipme"]
[source,python]
----
assert adder(1, 1) == 2
assert adder(2, 1) == 3
----

But you have the right to assume that the implementation isn't deliberately
screwy or perverse:

[role="skipme"]
[source,python]
----
def adder(a, b):
    # unlikely code!
    if a == 3:
        return 666
    else:
        return a + b
----

One way of putting it is: trust yourself not to do something _deliberately_ silly, but do protect against things that might be _accidentally_ silly.
*******************************************************************************

((("Meta attributes")))((("constraints", "for form input uniqueness, in Meta attributes")))
Just like `ModelForm`, models can use an inner class called `Meta`,
and that's where we can implement a constraint
that says an item must be unique for a particular list—or, in other words, that `text` and `list` must be unique together:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/models.py (ch16l005)
====
[source,python]
----
class Item(models.Model):
    text = models.TextField(default="")
    list = models.ForeignKey(List, default=None, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ("list", "text")
----
====

And that passes:

----
Ran 24 tests in 0.024s

OK
----

You might want to take a quick peek at the
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/models/options[Django docs on model `Meta` attributes]
at this point.



[[rewrite-model-test]]
==== Rewriting the Old Model Test

That long-winded model test did serendipitously help us find unexpected
bugs, but now it's time to rewrite it. I wrote it in a very verbose style to
introduce the Django ORM, but in fact, we can get the same coverage from a
couple of much shorter tests.
Delete `test_saving_and_retrieving_items` and replace it with this:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_models.py (ch16l006)
====
[source,python]
----
class ListAndItemModelsTest(TestCase):
    def test_default_text(self):
        item = Item()
        self.assertEqual(item.text, "")

    def test_item_is_related_to_list(self):
        mylist = List.objects.create()
        item = Item()
        item.list = mylist
        item.save()
        self.assertIn(item, mylist.item_set.all())

    [...]
----
====

That's more than enough really--a check of the default values of attributes
on a freshly initialised model object is enough to sense-check that we've
probably set some fields up in 'models.py'.  The "item is related to list" test
is a real "belt and braces" test to make sure that our foreign key relationship
works.

While we're at it, we can split this file out into tests for `Item` and tests
for `List` (there's only one of the latter, `test_get_absolute_url`):

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_models.py (ch16l007)
====
[source,python]
----
class ItemModelTest(TestCase):
    def test_default_text(self):
        [...]


class ListModelTest(TestCase):
    def test_get_absolute_url(self):
        [...]
----
====

That's neater and tidier:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test lists*]
[...]
Ran 25 tests in 0.092s

OK
----


==== Integrity Errors That Show Up on Save

((("data integrity errors")))((("database migrations", "data integrity errors on uniqueness")))
A final aside before we move on.
Do you remember the discussion mentioned in <<chapter_14_database_layer_validation>>
that some data integrity errors _are_ picked up on save?
It all depends on whether the integrity constraint is actually being enforced by the database.

Try running `makemigrations` and you'll see
that Django wants to add the `unique_together` constraint to the database itself,
rather than just having it as an application-layer constraint:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'lists':
  src/lists/migrations/0005_alter_item_unique_together.py
    ~ Alter unique_together for item (1 constraint(s))
----
//ch16l005-1

Now let's run the migration:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py migrate*]
----

[role="pagebreak-before less_space"]
.What to Do If You See an IntegrityError When Running Migrations
*******************************************************************************
When you run the migration, you may encounter the following error:

[role="skipme small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py migrate*]
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: auth, contenttypes, lists, sessions

[...]
sqlite3.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: lists_item.list_id,
lists_item.text

[...]
django.db.utils.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: lists_item.list_id,
lists_item.text
----

The problem is that
we have at least one database record that _used_ to be valid
but, after introducing our new constraint—the `unique_together`—it's no longer compatible.

To fix this problem locally, we can just delete `src/db.sqlite3` and run the migration again.
We can do this because the database on our laptop is only used for dev,
so the data in it is not important.

In <<chapter_18_second_deploy>>, we'll deploy our new code to production,
and discuss what to do if we run into migrations and data integrity issues at that point.
*******************************************************************************

Now, if we change our duplicate test to do a `.save` instead of a
`.full_clean`...


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_models.py (ch16l008)
====
[source,python]
----
    def test_duplicate_items_are_invalid(self):
        mylist = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(list=mylist, text="bla")
        with self.assertRaises(ValidationError):
            item = Item(list=mylist, text="bla")
            # item.full_clean()
            item.save()
----
====

[role="pagebreak-before"]
It gives:

----
ERROR: test_duplicate_items_are_invalid
(lists.tests.test_models.ItemModelTest.test_duplicate_items_are_invalid)
[...]
sqlite3.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: lists_item.list_id,

[...]
django.db.utils.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: lists_item.list_id,
lists_item.text
----

You can see that the error bubbles up from SQLite, and it's a different
error from the one we want—an `IntegrityError` instead of a `ValidationError`.

Let's revert our changes to the test, and see them all passing again:

[role="dofirst-ch16l008-1"]

=== Experimenting with Duplicate Item Validation at the Views Layer


((("duplicate items testing", "at the views layer", secondary-sortas="views layer")))
Let's try running our FT, to see if that's made any difference.

----
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: .invalid-feedback; [...]
----

In case you didn't see it as it flew past, the site is 500ing,footnote:[500ing, showing a server error, code 500—of course you can use HTTP status codes as verbs!]
as in <<integrity-error-unique-constraint>> (feel free to try it out manually).

[[integrity-error-unique-constraint]]
.Well, at least it didn't make it into the database
image::images/tdd3_1601.png["The Django Debug Page showing an IntegrityError, details 'UNIQUE constraint failed: lists_item.list_id, lists_item.text', and traceback"]

[role="pagebreak-before"]
We need to be clearer on what we want to happen at the views level.
Let's write a unit test to set out our expectations:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_views.py (ch16l009)
====
[source,python]
----
class ListViewTest(TestCase):
    [...]
    def test_for_invalid_input_nothing_saved_to_db(self):
        [...]
    def test_for_invalid_input_renders_list_template(self):
        [...]
    def test_for_invalid_input_shows_error_on_page(self):
        [...]

    def test_duplicate_item_validation_errors_end_up_on_lists_page(self):
        list1 = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(list=list1, text="textey")

        response = self.client.post(
            f"/lists/{list1.id}/",
            data={"text": "textey"},
        )

        expected_error = html.escape("You've already got this in your list")
        self.assertContains(response, expected_error)  # <1>
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "list.html")  # <2>
        self.assertEqual(Item.objects.all().count(), 1)  # <3>
----
====

<1> Here's our main assertion,
  which is that we want to see a nice error message on the page.

<2> Here's where we check that it's landing on the normal list page.

<3> And we double-check that we haven't saved anything to the database.footnote:[
Harry, didn't we spend time in the last chapter making sure all the asserts
were in different tests?  Absolutely yes.  Feel free to do that!
If I had to justify myself,
I'd say that we already have all the granular asserts for _one_ error type,
and this really is just a smoke test that an additional error type is also handled. So, arguably, it doesn't need to be so granular.]


That test confirms that the `IntegrityError` is bubbling all the way up:

----
  File "...goat-book/src/lists/views.py", line 28, in view_list
    form.save(for_list=our_list)
    ~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[...]
django.db.utils.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: lists_item.list_id,
lists_item.text
----

We want to avoid integrity errors!
Ideally, we want the call to `is_valid()` to somehow notice
the duplication error before we even try to save.
But to do that, our form will need to know in advance what list it's being used for.
Let's put a skip on this test for now:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_views.py (ch16l010)
====
[source,python]
----
from unittest import skip
[...]

    @skip
    def test_duplicate_item_validation_errors_end_up_on_lists_page(self):
----
====

// IDEA: alternatively, try/except on the validation error,
// get everything passing, then refactor to use a form.
// use the forms tests to explore the api (introduce the idea of a spike)
// maybe get it working, show how the forms-layer tests are annoying
// and switch to only views-layer tests


=== A More Complex Form to Handle Uniqueness Validation

((("duplicate items testing", "complex form for")))
((("uniqueness validation", seealso="duplicate items testing")))
The form to create a new list only needs to know one thing: the new item text.
A form validating that list items are unique will
need to know what list they're in as well.
Just as we overrode the save method on our `ItemForm`,
this time we'll override the _constructor_ on our new form class
so that it knows what list it applies to.

Let's duplicate our tests from the previous form, tweaking them slightly:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_forms.py (ch16l011)
====
[source,python]
----
[...]
from lists.forms import (
    DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR,
    EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR,
    ExistingListItemForm,
    ItemForm,
)
[...]

class ExistingListItemFormTest(TestCase):
    def test_form_renders_item_text_input(self):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=list_)  # <1>
        self.assertIn('placeholder="Enter a to-do item"', form.as_p())

    def test_form_validation_for_blank_items(self):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=list_, data={"text": ""})
        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
        self.assertEqual(form.errors["text"], [EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR])

    def test_form_validation_for_duplicate_items(self):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(list=list_, text="no twins!")
        form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=list_, data={"text": "no twins!"})
        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
        self.assertEqual(form.errors["text"], [DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR])
----
====

<1> We're specifying that our new `ExistingListItemForm` will take
    an argument `for_list=` in its constructor,
    to be able to specify which list the item is for.

Next we iterate through a few TDD cycles until we get a form with a
custom constructor, which just ignores its `for_list` argument.
(I won't show them all, but I'm sure you'll do them, right? Remember, the Goat
sees all.)


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch16l012)
====
[source,python]
----
DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR = "You've already got this in your list"
[...]
class ExistingListItemForm(forms.models.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, for_list, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
----
====

At this point, our error should be:

----
ValueError: ModelForm has no model class specified.
----

Then, let's see if making it inherit from our existing form helps:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch16l013)
====
[source,python]
----
class ExistingListItemForm(ItemForm):
    def __init__(self, for_list, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
----
====

Yes, that takes us down to just one failure:

----
FAIL: test_form_validation_for_duplicate_items (lists.tests.test_forms.Existing
ListItemFormTest.test_form_validation_for_duplicate_items)
[...]
    self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
AssertionError: True is not false
----

The next step requires a little knowledge of Django's validation system—you can read up on it in the Django docs on
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/models/instances/#validating-objects[model
validation] and
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/forms/validation[form validation].

[role="pagebreak-before"]
We can customise validation for a field by implementing a `clean_<fieldname>()`
method, and raising a `ValidationError` if the field is invalid:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch16l013-1)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
[...]

class ExistingListItemForm(ItemForm):
    def __init__(self, for_list, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.instance.list = for_list

    def clean_text(self):
        text = self.cleaned_data["text"]
        if self.instance.list.item_set.filter(text=text).exists():
            raise forms.ValidationError(DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR)
        return text
----
====

That makes the tests happy:

----
Found 29 test(s).
[...]
OK (skipped=1)
----


We're there!  A quick commit:

[role="skipme small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]

=== Using the Existing List Item Form in the List View

((("duplicate items testing", "in the list view", secondary-sortas="list view", id="DITlist15")))
Now let's see if we can put this form to work in our view. We remove the skip and, while we're at it, we can use our new constant:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_views.py (ch16l014)
====
[source,python]
----
from lists.forms import (
    DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR,
    EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR,
)
[...]

    def test_duplicate_item_validation_errors_end_up_on_lists_page(self):
        [...]
        expected_error = html.escape(DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR)
        self.assertContains(response, expected_error)
        [...]
----
====

[role="pagebreak-before"]
We see our `IntegrityError` once again:

----
django.db.utils.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: lists_item.list_id,
lists_item.text
----

Our fix for this is to switch to using the new form class:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/views.py (ch16l016)
====
[source,python]
----
from lists.forms import ExistingListItemForm, ItemForm
[...]
def view_list(request, list_id):
    our_list = List.objects.get(id=list_id)
    form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=our_list)  # <1>

    if request.method == "POST":
        form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=our_list, data=request.POST)  # <1>
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save(for_list=our_list)  # <2>
            [...]
    [...]
----
====

<1> We swap out `ItemForm` for `ExistingListItemForm`, and pass in the `for_list=`.

<2> This is a bit annoying—we're duplicating the `for_list=` argument.
    This form should already know this!

==== Customising the Save Method on Our New Form

Programming by wishful thinking, as always. Let's specify in our _views.py_ that we wish we could call `save()`
without the duplicated argument:

<1> This manually calls the grandparent `save()`.
    Personal opinion here: I could have used `super()`,
    but I prefer not to use `super()` when it requires arguments,
    say, to get a grandparent.
    I find Python 3's `super()` with no arguments is awesome to get the immediate parent.
    Anything else is too error-prone—and, besides, I find it ugly. YMMV.

// SEBASTIAN: IMHO it's actually Django's fault that it handles code reuse using inheritance and methods overriding
//      Wouldn't do the same thing, but it's your book and your opinion so I shall close my mouth :D

Let's spin up the server with `runserver` and try it out manually—with DevTools open—to see what's going on.
If you look through the HTML, you'll see our error `div` is there,
with the correct error text, but it's greyed out, indicating that it's hidden (as in <<devtools_error_div_hidden>>).

I had to dig through https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/forms/validation/#server-side[the docs] a little, but it turns out that Bootstrap requires form elements
with errors to have _another_ custom class, `is-invalid`. You can actually try this out in DevTools!
If you double-click, you can edit the HTML and add the class,
as in <<devtools_closeup_edit_html>>.

=== Conditionally Customising CSS Classes for Invalid Forms

Speaking of hackery, I'm starting to get a bit nervous
about the amount of hackery we're doing in our forms now,
but let's try getting this to work by doing _even more_
customisation in our forms.

We want this behaviour for both types of form really,
so it can go in the tests for the parent `ItemForm` class:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_forms.py (ch16l019-1)
====

class ItemFormTest(TestCase):

        [...]

    def test_invalid_form_has_bootstrap_is_invalid_css_class(self):
        form = ItemForm(data={"text": ""})
        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
        field = form.fields["text"]
        self.assertEqual(
            field.widget.attrs["class"],  # <1>
            "form-control form-control-lg is-invalid",
        )

    def test_form_save_handles_saving_to_a_list(self):
        [...]
----
====

<1> Here's where you can inspect the `class` attribute on the input field `widget`.

[role="pagebreak-before"]
And here's how we can make it work, by overriding the `is_valid()` method:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/forms.py (ch16l019-2)
====
[source,python]
----
class ItemForm(forms.models.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        [...]

    def is_valid(self):
        result = super().is_valid()  # <1>
        if not result:
            self.fields["text"].widget.attrs["class"] += " is-invalid"  # <2>
        return result  # <3>

    def save(self, for_list):
        [...]
----
====

<1> We make sure to call the parent `is_valid()` method first,
    so we can do all the normal built-in validation.

<2> Here's how we add the extra CSS class to our `widget`.

<3> And we remember to return the result.

It's not _too_ bad—but, as I say, I'm getting nervous about the amount
of fiddly code in our forms classes.
Let's make a note on our scratchpad, and come back to it when our FT is passing perhaps:

==== A Little Digression on Queryset Ordering and String Representations

((("queryset ordering", id="queryset15")))
((("string representations", id="triprep15")))
Something seems to be going wrong with the ordering of our list items.
Trying to fix this by iterating against an FT is going to be slow,
so let's work at the unit test level.

We'll add a test that checks that list items are ordered
in the sequence they are inserted.
You'll have to forgive me if I jump straight to the right answer,
using intuition borne of long experience,
but I suspect that it might be sorting alphabetically based on list text instead
(what else would it sort by after all?),
so I'll pick some text values designed to test that hypothesis:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_models.py (ch16l020)
====
[source,python]
----
class ListModelTest(TestCase):
    def test_get_absolute_url(self):
        [...]

    def test_list_items_order(self):
        list1 = List.objects.create()
        item1 = Item.objects.create(list=list1, text="i1")
        item2 = Item.objects.create(list=list1, text="item 2")
        item3 = Item.objects.create(list=list1, text="3")
        self.assertEqual(
            list1.item_set.all(),
            [item1, item2, item3],
        )
----
====

TIP: FTs are a slow feedback loop.
    Switch to unit tests when you want to drill down on edge case bugs.


That gives us a new failure, but it's not very readable:

----
AssertionError: <QuerySet [<Item: Item object (3)>, <Item[40 chars]2)>]> !=
[<Item: Item object (1)>, <Item: Item obj[29 chars](3)>]
----

We need a better string representation for our `Item` model.
Let's add another unit test:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_models.py (ch16l021)
====
[source,python]
----
class ItemModelTest(TestCase):
    [...]
    def test_string_representation(self):
        item = Item(text="some text")
        self.assertEqual(str(item), "some text")
----
====

NOTE: Ordinarily, you would be wary of adding more failing tests
    when you already have some--it
    makes reading test output that much more complicated,
    and just generally makes you nervous.
    Will we ever get back to a working state?
    In this case, they're all quite simple tests, so I'm not worried.

That gives us:

----
AssertionError: 'Item object (None)' != 'some text'
----

[role="pagebreak-before"]
And it also gives us the other two failures.  Let's start fixing them all now:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/models.py (ch16l022)
====
[source,python]
----
class Item(models.Model):
    [...]

    def __str__(self):
        return self.text
----
====

Now we're down to one failure, and the ordering test has a more readable
failure message:

----
AssertionError: <QuerySet [<Item: 3>, <Item: i1>, <Item: item 2>]> != [<Item:
i1>, <Item: item 2>, <Item: 3>]
----

That confirms our suspicion that the ordering was alphabetical.

We can fix that in the `class Meta`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/models.py (ch16l023)
====
[source,python]
----
class Item(models.Model):
    [...]
    class Meta:
        ordering = ("id",)
        unique_together = ("list", "text")
----
====

Does that work?

----
AssertionError: <QuerySet [<Item: i1>, <Item: item 2>, <Item: 3>]> != [<Item:
i1>, <Item: item 2>, <Item: 3>]
----

Urp?  It has worked; you can see the items _are_ in the same order,
but the tests are confused.

I keep running into this problem actually--Django
QuerySets don't compare well with lists.
We can fix it by converting the QuerySet to a list in our test:footnote:[You could also check out `assertSequenceEqual` from `unittest`, and
`assertQuerysetEqual` from Django's test tools—although I confess, when I last looked at `assertQuerysetEqual`,
I was quite baffled...]

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_models.py (ch16l024)
====
[source,python]
----
    self.assertEqual(
        list(list1.item_set.all()),
        [item1, item2, item3],
    )
----
====

//      That said, if it wasn't shown before in the book
//      https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/db/queries/#comparing-objects

[role="pagebreak-before"]
That works; we get a fully passing unit test suite:

----

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* Review amount of hackery in forms.py.

[role="pagebreak-before"]
Let's take a look at the current state of our forms classes.
We've got a real mix of presentation logic,
validation logic, and ORM/storage logic:

[source,python]
----
class ItemForm(forms.models.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Item
        fields = ("text",)
        widgets = {
            "text": forms.widgets.TextInput(
                attrs={
                    "placeholder": "Enter a to-do item",  # <1>
                    "class": "form-control form-control-lg",  # <1>
                }
            ),
        }
        error_messages = {"text": {"required": EMPTY_ITEM_ERROR}}

    def is_valid(self):
        result = super().is_valid()
        if not result:
            self.fields["text"].widget.attrs["class"] += " is-invalid"  # <1>
        return result

    def save(self, for_list):  # <3>
        self.instance.list = for_list
        return super().save()


class ExistingListItemForm(ItemForm):
    def __init__(self, for_list, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.instance.list = for_list  # <3>

    def clean_text(self):
        text = self.cleaned_data["text"]
        if self.instance.list.item_set.filter(text=text).exists():  <2>
            raise forms.ValidationError(DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR)  <2>
        return text

    def save(self):
        return forms.models.ModelForm.save(self)  # <3>
----
====

<1> Presentation logic
<2> Validation logic
<3> ORM/storage logic

////
I'm also nervous about the fact that we're overriding parts of the forms
API, like `is_valid()`, and `save()`. Not only that, but;

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.src/lists/forms.py
====
[source,python]
----
class ItemForm(forms.models.ModelForm):
    def save(self, for_list):  # <1>
        [...]

class ExistingListItemForm(ItemForm):
    def __init__(self, for_list, *args, **kwargs):  # <2>
        [...]
    def save(self):  # <3>
        return forms.models.ModelForm.save(self)
----
====

<1> Here we not only override the forms API method,
    but we actually _change_ the API, meaning that `ItemForm` no longer matches
    the normal forms API

<2> It's the same here where we override the constructor to add the `for_list` argument.

<3> And in this one, we change the `save()` API _again_,
    so the API isn't even consistent within our own inheritance hierarchy.

Without wanting to get all OO-nerdy, this is a violation of the
Liskov Substitution Principle, which basically says that subclasses should
look like their parents.footnote:[
Read a better write-up here: https://realpython.com/solid-principles-python/]
////

I think what's happened is that we've reached the limits of the Django forms framework's sweet spot.
`ModelForms` can be great _because_ they can do presentation, validation, and database storage all in one go, so you can get a lot done without much code.
But once you want to customise the default behaviours for each of those things,
the code you _do_ end up writing starts to get hard to understand.

Let's see what things would look like if we tried to:

. Move the responsibility for presentation and the rendering of HTML back into the template.
. Stop using `ModelForm` and do any database logic more explicitly,
  with less magic.
// 3. Tried to remove some of the Liskov violations


.Another Flip-flop!
*******************************************************************************
We spent most of the last chapter switching from handcrafted HTML
to having our form autogenerated by Django, and now we're switching back. It's a little frustrating,
and I could have gone back and changed the book's outline to avoid the back and forth,
but I prefer to show software development as it really is.

We often try things out and end up changing our minds.
Particularly with frameworks like Django,
you can find yourself taking advantage of autogenerated shortcuts for as long as they work. But at some point, you meet the limits of what the framework designers have anticipated,
and it's time to go back to doing the work yourself.

Frameworks have trade-offs. It doesn't mean you should always reinvent the wheel! It’s OK to cut yourself some slack for “wasting time” on avenues that don’t work out, or revisiting decisions that worked well in the past, but don't work so well now.

*******************************************************************************

==== Moving Presentation Logic Back into the Template

We're talking about another refactor here;
we want to move some functionality out of the form
and into the template/views layer.((("templates", "moving presentation logic from form back to")))((("presentation logic, moving from form to template")))
How do we make sure we've got good test coverage?

* We currently have some tests for the CSS classes including `is-invalid`
  in _test_forms.py_.

* We have some tests of some form attributes in _test_views.py_—e.g., the asserts on the input's `name`.

* And the FTs, ultimately, will tell us if things
  "really work" or not, including testing the interaction between our HTML,
  Bootstrap, and the browser (e.g., CSS visibility).

What we are learning is that the things we're testing in _test_forms.py_
will need to move.

TIP: Lower-level tests are good for exploring an API,
    but they are tightly coupled to it.
    Higher-level tests can enable more refactoring.


Here's one way to write that kind of test:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/tests/test_views.py (ch16l025-1)

        response = self.post_invalid_input()
        parsed = lxml.html.fromstring(response.content)
        [input] = parsed.cssselect("input[name=text]")
        self.assertIn("is-invalid", input.get("class"))

Let's revert that and get back to passing.

let's bring back our handcrafted HTML.

<1> Here's our artisan `<input>` once again,
  and the most important custom setting will be its `class` attributes.

<2> As you can see, we can use conditionals even for providing additional ++class++-es.footnote:[
    We've split the `input` tag across multiple lines so it fits nicely on the screen.
    If you've not seen that before, it may look a little weird,
    but I promise it is valid HTML.
    You don't have to use it if you don't like it though.]

<3> The `| default` "filter" is a way to avoid the string "None"
    from showing up as the value in our input field.

<4> We add an `id` to the error message
    to be able to use `aria-describedby` on the input,
    as recommended in the Bootstrap docs;
    it makes the error message more accessible to screen readers.

<5> If you just try to use `form.errors.text`, you'll see
    that Django injects a `<ul>` list,
    because the forms framework can report multiple errors for each field.
    We know we've only got one, so we can use use `form.errors.text.0`.

Hmm, that's not ideal actually. Let's tweak our assert:

        self.assertIn("is-invalid", set(input.classes))  # <1>

====

<1> Rather than using `get("class")`, which returns a raw string,
    `lxml` can give us the classes as a list
    (well, actually a special object, but one that we can turn into a set).

That's more semantically correct, and gives a better error message:

----
    self.assertIn("is-invalid", set(input.classes))

And we're in a better place I think!

We still have the Liskov violations on the `__init__()` and `save()`,
but perhaps we can live with those for now.

TODO: start by addressing this in 15, ch14l034,
no need to pass the `for_list=` into the save() method.

=== Wrapping Up: What We've Learned About Testing Django

((("class-based generic views (CBGVs)", "key tests and assertions")))
((("Django framework", "class-based generic views")))
We're now at a point where our app looks a lot more like a "standard" Django app,
and it implements the three common Django layers: models, forms, and views.
We no longer have any "training wheel&#x201d; tests,
and our code looks pretty much like code we'd be happy to see in a real app.((("models, forms, and views  (Django layers)")))

We have one unit test file for each of our key source code files.
Here's a recap of the biggest (and highest-level) one: _test_views_.


[[what-to-test-in-views]]
.Wrap-Up: What to Test in Views
******************************************************************************

By way of a recap, let's see an outline of all the test methods and main
assertions in our `test_views`. ((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "testing in views")))This isn't to say you should copy-paste these
exactly—it's more like a list of things you should at least consider testing:

<1> Use the Django test client.

<2> Optionally (this is a bit of an implementation detail),
    check the template used.

<3> Check that key parts of your HTML are present.
    Things that are critical to the integration of frontend and backend
    are good candidates, like form action and input `name` attributes.
    Using `lxml` might be overkill, but it does give you less brittle tests.

<4> Think about smoke-testing any other template contents,
    or any logic in the template:
    any `{% for %}` or `{% if %}` might deserve a check.

<5> For POST requests, test the valid case via its database side effects,
    and the redirect response.

<6> For invalid requests, it's worth a basic check that errors
    make it back to the template.

<7> You don't _always_ have to have ultra-granular tests though.

Next, we'll try to make our data validation more friendly

Uh-oh, you know what that means...
