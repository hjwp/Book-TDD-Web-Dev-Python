Testing Database Migrations
---------------------------



((("database migrations", id="dbmig30")))((("database testing", "migrations", id="DBTmig30")))Django-migrations and its predecessor South have been around for ages,
so it's not usually necessary to test database migrations.  But it just
so happens that we're introducing a dangerous type of migration--that is, one
that introduces a new integrity constraint on our data.  When I first ran
the migration script against staging, I saw an error.

On larger projects, where you have sensitive data, you may want the additional
confidence that comes from testing your migrations in a safe environment
before applying them to production data, so this toy example will hopefully
be a useful rehearsal.

Another common reason to want to test migrations is for speed--migrations
often involve downtime, and sometimes, when they're applied to very large
datasets, they can take time.  It's good to know in advance how long that
might be.


An Attempted Deploy to Staging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Here's what happened to me when I first tried to deploy our new validation
constraints in <<chapter_17_second_deploy>>:


[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*cd deploy_tools*]
$ pass:quotes[*fab deploy:host=elspeth@staging.ottg.co.uk*]
[...]
Running migrations:
  Applying lists.0005_list_item_unique_together...Traceback (most recent call
last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py",
line 61, in execute
    return self.cursor.execute(sql, params)
  File
"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py",
line 475, in execute
    return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query, params)
sqlite3.IntegrityError: columns list_id, text are not unique
[...]
----


What happened was that some of the existing data in the database violated
the integrity constraint, so the database was complaining when I tried to 
apply it.

In order to deal with this sort of problem, we'll need to build a "data
migration".  Let's first set up a local environment to test against.


Running a Test Migration Locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We'll use a copy of the live database to test our migration against.

WARNING: Be very, very, very careful when using real data for testing.  For 
    example, you may have real customer email addresses in there, and you don't
    want to accidentally send them a bunch of test emails.  Ask me how I know
    this.


Entering Problematic Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start a list with some duplicate items on your live site, as shown in
<<dupe-data>>.

[[dupe-data]]
.A list with duplicate items
image::images/twp2_ad01.png["This list has 3 identical items"]


Copying Test Data from the Live Site
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Copy the database down from live:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *scp elspeth@superlists.ottg.co.uk:\
/home/elspeth/sites/superlists.ottg.co.uk/database/db.sqlite3 .*
$ *mv ../database/db.sqlite3 ../database/db.sqlite3.bak*
$ *mv db.sqlite3 ../database/db.sqlite3*
----


Confirming the Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now have a local database that has not been migrated, and that contains
some problematic data.  We should see an error if we try to run `migrate`:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py migrate --migrate*
python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
[...]
Running migrations:
[...]
  Applying lists.0005_list_item_unique_together...Traceback (most recent call
last):
[...]
    return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query, params)
sqlite3.IntegrityError: columns list_id, text are not unique
----


Inserting a Data Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/migrations/#data-migrations[Data
migrations] are a special type of migration that modifies data in the database
rather than changing the schema.  We need to create one that will run before
we apply the integrity constraint, to preventively remove any duplicates.
Here's how we can do that:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*git rm lists/migrations/0005_list_item_unique_together.py*]
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py makemigrations lists --empty*]
Migrations for 'lists':
  0005_auto_20140414_2325.py:
$ pass:[<strong>mv lists/migrations/0005_*.py lists/migrations/0005_remove_duplicates.py</strong>]
----

Check out https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/migrations/#data-migrations[the
Django docs on data migrations] for more info, but here's how we add some
instructions to change existing data:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/migrations/0005_remove_duplicates.py
====
[source,python]
----
# encoding: utf8
from django.db import models, migrations

def find_dupes(apps, schema_editor):
    List = apps.get_model("lists", "List")
    for list_ in List.objects.all():
        items = list_.item_set.all()
        texts = set()
        for ix, item in enumerate(items):
            if item.text in texts:
                item.text = '{} ({})'.format(item.text, ix)
                item.save()
            texts.add(item.text)


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('lists', '0004_item_list'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(find_dupes),
    ]
----
====


Re-creating the Old Migration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We re-create the old migration using `makemigrations`, which will ensure it
is now the sixth migration and has an explicit dependency on `0005`, the
data migration:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'lists':
  0006_auto_20140415_0018.py:
    - Alter unique_together for item (1 constraints)
$ pass:[<strong>mv lists/migrations/0006_* lists/migrations/0006_unique_together.py</strong>]
----


Testing the New Migrations Together
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We're now ready to run our test against the live data:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*cd deploy_tools*]
$ pass:quotes[*fab deploy:host=elspeth@staging.ottg.co.uk*]
[...]
----

We'll need to restart the live Gunicorn job too:

[role="server-commands skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo systemctl restart gunicorn-superlists.ottg.co.uk*
----


And we can now run our FTs against staging:

[role="skipme small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*STAGING_SERVER=staging.ottg.co.uk python manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]
....
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 17.308s

OK
----


Everything seems in order!  Let's do it against live:


[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*fab deploy:host=superlists.ottg.co.uk*]
[superlists.ottg.co.uk] Executing task 'deploy'
[...]
----


And that's a wrap.  `git add lists/migrations`, `git commit`, and so on.


Conclusions
~~~~~~~~~~~

This exercise was primarily aimed at building a data migration and testing it
against some real data.  Inevitably, this is only a drop in the ocean of the 
possible testing you could do for a migration.  You could imagine building
automated tests to check that all your data was preserved, comparing the
database contents before and after.  You could write individual unit tests
for the helper functions in a data migration.  You could spend more time
measuring the time taken for migrations, and experiment with ways to speed
it up by, for example, breaking up migrations into more or fewer component steps.

Remember that this should be a relatively rare case. In my experience, I
haven't felt the need to test 99% of the migrations I've worked on.  But,
should you ever feel the need on your project, I hope you've found a few
pointers here to get started with.((("", startref="dbmig30")))((("", startref="DBTmig30")))

.On Testing Database Migrations
******************************************************************************

Be wary of migrations which introduce constraints::
    99% of migrations happen without a hitch, but be wary of any situations,
    like this one, where you are introducing a new constraint on columns that
    already exist.


Test migrations for speed::
    Once you have a larger project, you should think about testing how long
    your migrations are going to take. Database migrations typically involve
    downtime, as, depending on your database, the schema update operation may
    lock the table it's working on until it completes.  It's a good idea to use
    your staging site to find out how long a migration will take.


Be extremely careful if using a dump of production data::
    In order to do so, you'll want fill your staging site's database with an
    amount of data that's commensurate to the size of your production data.
    Explaining how to do that is outside of the scope of this book, but I will
    say this:  if you're tempted to just take a dump of your production
    database and load it into staging, be 'very' careful.  Production data
    contains real customer details, and I've personally been responsible for
    accidentally sending out a few hundred incorrect invoices after an
    automated process on my staging server started processing the copied
    production data I'd just loaded into it. Not a fun afternoon.
