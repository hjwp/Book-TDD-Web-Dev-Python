More Advanced Forms 
-------------------



Now let's look at some more advanced forms usage.  We've helped our users
to avoid blank list items, now let's help them avoid duplicate items.

This chapter goes into more intricate details of Django's form validation, and
you can consider it optional if you already know all about customising Django
forms.  If you're still learning Django, there's good stuff in here.  If you
want to skip ahead, that's OK too. Make sure you take a quick look at the aside
on developer stupidity, and the recap on testing views at the end.


Another FT for Duplicate Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We add a second test method to `ItemValidationTest`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/test_list_item_validation.py (ch12l001)
[source,python]
----
def test_cannot_add_duplicate_items(self):
    # Edith goes to the home page and starts a new list
    self.browser.get(self.server_url)
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys('Buy wellies\n')
    self.check_for_row_in_list_table('1: Buy wellies')

    # She accidentally tries to enter a duplicate item
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys('Buy wellies\n')

    # She sees a helpful error message
    self.check_for_row_in_list_table('1: Buy wellies')
    error = self.browser.find_element_by_css_selector('.has-error')
    self.assertEqual(error.text, "You've already got this in your list")
----

Why have two test methods rather than extending one, or having a new file
and class?  It's a judgement call.  These two feel closely related; they're
both about validation on the same input field, so it feels right to
keep them in the same file.  On the other hand, they're logically separate
enough that it's practical to keep them in different methods.

OK, so we know the first of the two tests passes now. Is there a way to run
just the failing one, I hear you ask?  Why yes indeed:

Preventing Duplicates at the Model Layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here's what we really wanted to do.  It's a new test that checks that duplicate
items in the same list raise an error:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py (ch09l028)
[source,python]
----
def test_duplicate_items_are_invalid(self):
    list_ = List.objects.create()
    Item.objects.create(list=list_, text='bla')
    with self.assertRaises(ValidationError):
        item = Item(list=list_, text='bla')
        item.full_clean()
----

And, while it occurs to us, we add another test to make sure we don't 
overdo it on our integrity constraints:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py (ch09l029)
[source,python]
----
def test_CAN_save_same_item_to_different_lists(self):
    list1 = List.objects.create()
    list2 = List.objects.create()
    Item.objects.create(list=list1, text='bla')
    item = Item(list=list2, text='bla')
    item.full_clean()  # should not raise
----

I always like to put a little comment for tests which are checking 
that a particular use case should 'not' raise an error; otherwise
it can be hard to see what's being tested.

----
AssertionError: ValidationError not raised
----

If we want to get it deliberately wrong, we can do this:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/models.py (ch09l030)
[source,python]
----
class Item(models.Model):
    text = models.TextField(default='', unique=True)
    list = models.ForeignKey(List, default=None)
----

That lets us check that our second test really does pick up on this
problem:

----
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspace/superlists/lists/tests/test_models.py", line 62, in
test_CAN_save_same_item_to_different_lists
    item.full_clean()  # should not raise
    [...]
django.core.exceptions.ValidationError: {'text': ['Item with this Text already
exists.']}
----

.An Aside on When to Test for Developer Stupidity
*******************************************************************************
One of the judgement calls in testing is when you should write tests that sound
like "check we haven't done something stupid".  In general, you should be wary
of these.

In this case, we've written a test to check that you can't save duplicate items
to the same list.  Now, the simplest way to get that test to pass, the way in
which you'd write the least lines of code, would be to make it impossible to
save 'any' duplicate items.  That justifies writing another test, despite the
fact that it would be a "stupid" or "wrong" thing for us to code.

But you can't be writing tests for every possible way we could have coded
something wrong.  If you have a function that adds two numbers, you can write
a couple of tests:

[role="skipme"]
[source,python]
----
assert adder(1, 1) == 2
assert adder(2, 1) == 3
----

But you have the right to assume that the implementation isn't deliberately
screwey or perverse:

[role="skipme"]
[source,python]
----
def adder(a, b):
    # unlikely code!
    if a == 3:
        return 666
    else:
        return a + b
----

One way of putting it is that you should trust yourself not to do something
'deliberately' stupid, but not something 'accidentally' stupid.
*******************************************************************************

Just like ++ModelForm++s, models have a `class Meta`, and that's where we can
implement a constraint which says that that an item must be unique for a
particular list, or in other words, that `text` and `list` must be unique together:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/models.py (ch09l031)
[source,python]
----
class Item(models.Model):
    text = models.TextField(default='')
    list = models.ForeignKey(List, default=None)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('list', 'text')
----

You might want to take a quick peek at the 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/models/options/[Django docs on model
`Meta` attributes] at this point.


A Little Digression on Queryset Ordering and String Representations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


When we run the tests they reveal an unexpected failure:

[role="skipme"]
----
======================================================================
FAIL: test_saving_and_retrieving_items
(lists.tests.test_models.ListAndItemModelsTest)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspace/superlists/lists/tests/test_models.py", line 31, in
test_saving_and_retrieving_items
    self.assertEqual(first_saved_item.text, 'The first (ever) list item')
AssertionError: 'Item the second' != 'The first (ever) list item'
- Item the second
[...]
----

NOTE: Depending on your platform and its SQLite installation, you may
not see this error. You can follow along anyway; the code and tests are
interesting in their own right.

That's a bit of a puzzler. A bit of print-based debugging:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py
[source,python]
----
    first_saved_item = saved_items[0]
    print(first_saved_item.text)
    second_saved_item = saved_items[1]
    print(second_saved_item.text)
    self.assertEqual(first_saved_item.text, 'The first (ever) list item')
----

Will show us...

[role="skipme"]
----
.....Item the second
The first (ever) list item
F.....
----

It looks like our uniqueness constraint has messed with the default ordering
of queries like `Item.objects.all()`.  Although we already have a failing test,
it's best to add a new test that explicitly tests for ordering:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py (ch09l032)
[source,python]
----
    def test_list_ordering(self):
        list1 = List.objects.create()
        item1 = Item.objects.create(list=list1, text='i1')
        item2 = Item.objects.create(list=list1, text='item 2')
        item3 = Item.objects.create(list=list1, text='3')
        self.assertEqual(
            Item.objects.all(),
            [item1, item2, item3]
        )
----


That gives us a new failure, but it's not a very readable one:

----
AssertionError: [<Item: Item object>, <Item: Item object>, <Item: Item object>]
!= [<Item: Item object>, <Item: Item object>, <Item: Item object>]
----

We need a better string representation for our objects.  Let's add another
unit test:


NOTE: Ordinarily you would be wary of adding more failing tests when you
already have some--it makes reading test output that much more complicated,
and just generally makes you nervous. Will we ever get back to a working
state? In this case, they're all quite simple tests, so I'm not worried.

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py (ch12l008)
[source,python]
----
def test_string_representation(self):
    item = Item(text='some text')
    self.assertEqual(str(item), 'some text')
----

That gives us:

----
AssertionError: 'Item object' != 'some text'
----

As well as the other two failures.  Let's start fixing them all now:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/models.py (ch09l034)
[source,python]
----
class Item(models.Model):
    [...]

    def __str__(self):
        return self.text
----

NOTE: in Python 2.x versions of Django, the string representation method used
to be `__unicode__`. Like much string handling, this is simplified in Python 3.
See the
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/python3/#str-and-unicode-methods[docs].


Now we're down to two failures, and the ordering test has a more readable failure
message:

[role="skipme"]
----
AssertionError: [<Item: 3>, <Item: i1>, <Item: item 2>] != [<Item: i1>, <Item:
item 2>, <Item: 3>]
----

We can fix that in the `class Meta`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/models.py (ch09l035)
[source,python]
----
    class Meta:
        ordering = ('id',)
        unique_together = ('list', 'text')
----

Does that work?

----
AssertionError: [<Item: i1>, <Item: item 2>, <Item: 3>] != [<Item: i1>, <Item:
item 2>, <Item: 3>]
----

Urp?  It has worked; you can see the items 'are' in the same order, but the
tests are confused.  I keep running into this problem actually--Django
querysets don't compare well with lists.  We can fix it by converting the
queryset to a listfootnote:[You could also check out `assertSequenceEqual` from `unittest`, and
`assertQuerysetEqual` from Django's test tools, although I confess when I last
looked at `assertQuerysetEqual` I was quite baffled...]
in our test:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py (ch09l036)
[source,python]
----
    self.assertEqual(
        list(Item.objects.all()),
        [item1, item2, item3]
    )
----

That works; we get a fully passing test suite:

----
OK
----


Rewriting the Old Model Test 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That long-winded model test did serendipitously help us find an unexpected
bug, but now it's time to rewrite it. I wrote it in a very verbose style to
introduce the Django ORM, but in fact, now that we have the explicit test for
ordering, we can get the same coverage from a couple of much shorter tests. 
Delete `test_saving_and_retrieving_items` and replace with this:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py (ch12l010)
[source,python]
----
class ListAndItemModelsTest(TestCase):

    def test_default_text(self):
        item = Item()
        self.assertEqual(item.text, '')

        
    def test_item_is_related_to_list(self):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        item = Item()
        item.list = list_
        item.save()
        self.assertIn(item, list_.item_set.all())

    [...]
----
 
That's more than enough really--a check of the default values of attributes
on a freshly initialized model object is enough to sanity-check that we've
probably set some fields up in 'models.py'.  The "item is related to list" test
is a real "belt and braces" test to make sure that our foreign key relationship
works.

While we're at it, we can split this file out into tests for `Item` and tests
for `List` (there's only one of the latter, `test_get_absolute_url`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py (ch12l011)
[source,python]
----
class ItemModelTest(TestCase):

    def test_default_text(self):
        [...]



class ListModelTest(TestCase):

    def test_get_absolute_url(self):
        [...]
----

That's neater and tidier:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test lists*]
[...]
Ran 29 tests in 0.092s

OK
----


Some Integrity Errors Do Show Up on Save
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A final aside before we move on. Do you remember I mentioned in
<<manual-validation-chapter>> that some data integrity errors 'are' picked up
on save?  It all depends on whether the integrity constraint is actually being
enforced by the database.

Try running `makemigrations` and you'll see that Django wants to add the 
`unique_together` constraint to the database itself, rather than just having
it as an application-layer constraint:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'lists':
  0005_auto_20140414_2038.py:
    - Alter unique_together for item (1 constraints)
----

Now if we change our duplicates test to do a `.save` instead of a
`.full_clean`...

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_models.py
[source,python]
----
    def test_duplicate_items_are_invalid(self):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(list=list_, text='bla')
        with self.assertRaises(ValidationError):
            item = Item(list=list_, text='bla')
            # item.full_clean()
            item.save()
----

It gives:

----
ERROR: test_duplicate_items_are_invalid (lists.tests.test_models.ItemModelTest)
[...]
    return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query, params)
sqlite3.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: lists_item.list_id,
lists_item.text
[...]
django.db.utils.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: lists_item.list_id,
lists_item.text
----

You can see that the error bubbles up from SQLite, and it's a different
error to the one we want, an `IntegrityError` instead of a `ValidationError`.


Let's revert our changes to the test, and see them all passing again:

[role="dofirst-ch12l013"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test lists*]
[...]
Ran 29 tests in 0.092s
OK
----

And now it's time to commit our model-layer changes:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status* # should show changes to tests + models and new migration
# let's give our new migration a better name
$ @mv lists/migrations/0005_auto* lists/migrations/0005_list_item_unique_together.py@

$ *git diff --staged*
$ *git commit -am "Implement duplicate item validation at model layer"*

Experimenting with Duplicate Item Validation at the Views Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's try running our FT, just to see where we are:

----
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: 'Unable to locate
element: {"method":"id","selector":"id_list_table"}' ; Stacktrace: 
----

In case you didn't see it as it flew past, the site is 500ing.footnote:[It's showing a server error, code 500.  Gotta get with the jargon!]
A quick unit test at the view level ought to clear this up:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_views.py (ch12l014)
[source,python]
----
class ListViewTest(TestCase):
    [...]

    def test_for_invalid_input_shows_error_on_page(self):
        [...]


    def test_duplicate_item_validation_errors_end_up_on_lists_page(self):
        list1 = List.objects.create()
        item1 = Item.objects.create(list=list1, text='textey')
        response = self.client.post(
            '/lists/%d/' % (list1.id,),
            data={'text': 'textey'}
        )

        expected_error = escape("You've already got this in your list")
        self.assertContains(response, expected_error)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'list.html')
        self.assertEqual(Item.objects.all().count(), 1)
----

Gives:

----
django.db.utils.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: lists_item.list_id,
lists_item.text
----

We want to avoid integrity errors! Ideally, we want the call to `is_valid` to
somehow notice the duplication error before we even try to save, but to do
that, our form will need to know what list it's being used for, in advance.

Let's put a skip on that test for now:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_views.py (ch12l015)
[source,python]
----
from unittest import skip
[...]

    @skip
    def test_duplicate_item_validation_errors_end_up_on_lists_page(self):
----


A More Complex Form to Handle Uniqueness Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The form to create a new list only needs to know one thing, the new item text.
A form which validates that list items are unique needs to know both.  Just
like we overrode the save method on our `ItemForm`, this time we'll override
the constructor on our new form class so that it knows what list it applies to.

We duplicate our tests for the previous form, tweaking them slightly:

[role="sourcecode"]
[source,python]
.lists/tests/test_forms.py (ch12l016)
----
from lists.forms import (
    DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR, EMPTY_LIST_ERROR,
    ExistingListItemForm, ItemForm
)
[...]

class ExistingListItemFormTest(TestCase):

    def test_form_renders_item_text_input(self):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=list_)
        self.assertIn('placeholder="Enter a to-do item"', form.as_p())


    def test_form_validation_for_blank_items(self):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=list_, data={'text': ''})
        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
        self.assertEqual(form.errors['text'], [EMPTY_LIST_ERROR])


    def test_form_validation_for_duplicate_items(self):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(list=list_, text='no twins!')
        form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=list_, data={'text': 'no twins!'})
        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
        self.assertEqual(form.errors['text'], [DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR])
----

We can iterate through a few TDD cycles (I won't show them all, but I'm sure
you'll do them, right? Remember, the Goat sees all.) until we get a form with a
custom constructor, which just ignores its `for_list` argument:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/forms.py (ch09l071)
[source,python]
----
DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR = "You've already got this in your list"
[...]
class ExistingListItemForm(forms.models.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, for_list, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
----

Gives:

----
ValueError: ModelForm has no model class specified.
----

Now let's see if making it inherit from our existing form helps:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/forms.py (ch09l072)
[source,python]
----
class ExistingListItemForm(ItemForm):
    def __init__(self, for_list, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
----

That takes us down to just one failure:

----
FAIL: test_form_validation_for_duplicate_items
(lists.tests.test_forms.ExistingListItemFormTest)
    self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
AssertionError: True is not false
----

The next step requires a little knowledge of Django's internals, but you
can read up on it in the Django docs on 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/models/instances/#validating-objects[model
validation] and
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/forms/validation/[form validation].

Django uses a method called `validate_unique`, both on forms and models, and
we can use both, in conjunction with the `instance` attribute:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/forms.py
[source,python]
----
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
[...]

class ExistingListItemForm(ItemForm):

    def __init__(self, for_list, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.instance.list = for_list


    def validate_unique(self):
        try:
            self.instance.validate_unique()
        except ValidationError as e:
            e.error_dict = {'text': [DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR]}
            self._update_errors(e)
----
//ch10l018

That's a bit of Django voodoo right there, but we basically take the validation
error, adjust its error message, and then pass it back into the form.

And we're there!  A quick commit:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff*
$ *git commit -a*
----


Using the Existing List Item Form in the List View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's see if we can put this form to work in our view.

We remove the skip, and while we're at it, we can use our new constant. Tidy.

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_views.py (ch12l049)
[source,python]
----
from lists.forms import (
    DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR, EMPTY_LIST_ERROR,
    ExistingListItemForm, ItemForm,
)
[...]

    def test_duplicate_item_validation_errors_end_up_on_lists_page(self):
        [...]
        expected_error = escape(DUPLICATE_ITEM_ERROR)
----

That brings back out integrity error:

----
django.db.utils.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: lists_item.list_id,
lists_item.text
----

Our fix for this is to switch to using the new form class.  Before we implement
it, let's find the tests where we check the form class, and adjust them:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_views.py (ch12l050)
[source,python]
----
class ListViewTest(TestCase):
[...]

    def test_displays_item_form(self):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        response = self.client.get('/lists/%d/' % (list_.id,))
        self.assertIsInstance(response.context['form'], ExistingListItemForm)
        self.assertContains(response, 'name="text"')

    [...]

    def test_for_invalid_input_passes_form_to_template(self):
        response = self.post_invalid_input()
        self.assertIsInstance(response.context['form'], ExistingListItemForm)
----

That gives us:

----
AssertionError: <lists.forms.ItemForm object at 0x7f767e4b7f90> is not an
instance of <class 'lists.forms.ExistingListItemForm'>
----

So we can adjust the view:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch12l051)
[source,python]
----
from lists.forms import ExistingListItemForm, ItemForm
[...]
def view_list(request, list_id):
    list_ = List.objects.get(id=list_id)
    form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=list_)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=list_, data=request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            [...]
----


And that 'almost' fixes everything, except for an unexpected fail:

----
TypeError: save() missing 1 required positional argument: 'for_list'
----

Our custom save method from the parent `ItemForm` is no longer needed. 
Let's make a quick unit test for that:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests/test_forms.py (ch12l053)
[source,python]
----
def test_form_save(self):
    list_ = List.objects.create()
    form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=list_, data={'text': 'hi'})
    new_item = form.save()
    self.assertEqual(new_item, Item.objects.all()[0])
----

We can make our form call the grandparent save method:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/forms.py (ch12l054)
[source,python]
----
    def save(self):
        return forms.models.ModelForm.save(self)
----

NOTE: Personal opinion here: I could have used `super`, but I prefer not to use
`super` when it requires arguments, eg to get a grandparent method. I find
Python 3's `super()` with no args awesome to get the immediate parent. Anything
else is too error-prone, and I find it ugly besides. YMMV.


And we're there!  All the unit tests pass:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test lists*]
[...]
Ran 34 tests in 0.082s

OK
----

And so does our FT for validation:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests.test_list_item_validation*]
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
..
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 12.048s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
----

As a final check, we rerun 'all' the FTs:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests*]
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
....
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 19.048s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
----

Hooray! Time for a final commit, and a wrap-up of what we've learned about
testing views over the last few chapters.

<1> Use the Django test client.

<2> Check the template used.  Then, check each item in the template context.

<3> Check any objects are the right ones, or querysets have the
    correct items.

<4> Check any forms are of the correct class.

<5> Test any template logic:  any `for` or `if` should get a minimal test.

<6> For views that handle POST requests, make sure you test both the valid
    case and the invalid case.

<7> Sanity-check that your form is rendered, and its errors are displayed.

Why these points?  Skip ahead to <<appendix2>>, and I'll show how
they are sufficient to ensure that our views are still correct if we refactor
them to start using class-based views.

******************************************************************************

Next we'll try and make our data validation more friendly by using a bit
of client-side code.  Uh-oh, you know what that means...
