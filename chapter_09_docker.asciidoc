Is all fun and game until you are need of put it in production.

((("deployment", "testing using staging sites", id="DEPstage09")))
It's time to deploy the first version of our site and make it public.
 They say that if you wait until you feel _ready_ to ship,
then you've waited too long.

Is our site usable?
Is it better than nothing?
Can we make lists on it?
Yes, yes, yes.

No, you can't log in yet.
No, you can't mark tasks as completed.
But do we really need any of that stuff?
Not really--and you can never be sure
what your users are _actually_ going to do with your site
once they get their hands on it.
We think our users want to use the site for to-do lists,
but maybe they actually want to use it
to make "top 10 best fly-fishing spots" lists,
for which you don't _need_ any kind of "mark completed" function.
We won't know until we put it out there.

Over the next couple of chapters we're going to go through
and actually deploy our site to a real, live web server.

You might be tempted to skip this bit--there's
lots of daunting stuff in it,
and maybe you think this isn't what you signed up for.
But I _strongly_ urge you to give it a go.
This is one of the sections of the book I'm most pleased with,
and it's one that people often write to me
saying they were really glad they stuck through it.

If you've never done a server deployment before,
it will demystify a whole world for you,
and there's nothing like the feeling of seeing your site live
on the actual internet.
Give it a buzzword name like "DevOps"
if that's what it takes to convince you it's worth it.

// TODO move this to next chapter

NOTE: Why not ping me a note once your site is live on the web,
    and send me the URL?
    It always gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling...

=== TDD and the Danger Areas of Deployment

Deploying a site to a live web server can be a tricky topic.
Oft-heard is the forlorn cry __"but it works on my machine!"__

((("deployment", "danger areas of")))
Some of the danger areas of deployment include:

Networking::
    Once we're off our own machine, networking issues come in:
    making sure that DNS is routing our domain
    to the correct IP address for our server,
    making sure our server is configured
    to listen to traffic coming in from the world,
    making sure it's using the right ports,
    and making sure any firewalls in the way
    are configured to let traffic through.

Dependencies::
    We need to make sure that the packages our software relies on
    (Python, Django, and so on) are installed on the server,
    and have the correct versions.

The database::
    There can be permissions and path issues,
    and we need to be careful about preserving data between deploys.

Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)::
    Web servers usually need special configuration for serving these.
    ((("static files", "challenges of")))

Security and Configuration::
    Once we're on the public internet,
    we need to worry more about security.
    Various settings that are really useful for local development
    (like the Django debug page)
    become dangerous in production
    (because they expose our source code in tracebacks).


One way to approach the problem is to get a server,
and start manually configuring and installing everything,
hacking about until it works,
and maybe think about automating things laterfootnote:[
This was, more or less, the approach I took in earlier editions of the book.
With a fair bit of testing thrown in of course.].

But if there's one thing we've learned
in the world of agile/lean software development,
it's that taking smaller steps usually pays off.

How can we take smaller, safer steps towards a production deployment?
Can we _simulate_ the process of moving to a server,
so that we can iron out all the bugs,
before we actually take the plunge?

Absolutely we can.  And from the title of the chapter,
I'm sure you're already guessing that Docker is going
to be part of the answer.


=== Docker, Containers and Virtualization

// TODO: experiment with moving this intro to docker
// to before the tdd danger areas bit.

Docker is a commercial product that wraps several free
and open source technologies from the world of Linux,
sometimes referred to as "containerization".

You may have already heard of the idea of "virtualization",
which allows a single physical computer to pretend to be several machines.
Pioneered by IBM (amongst others) on mainframes in the 1960s,
it rose to mainstream adoption in the 90s,
where it was sold as a way to optimise resource usage in datacentres.
AWS, for example, was an offshoot of Amazon,
who were using virtualization already,
and realised they could sell some spare capacity on their servers
to customers outside the business.

So when you come to deploy your code to a real server in a datacentre,
it will be using virtualization.
And actually you can use virtualization on your own machine,
with software like Virtualbox or KVM.

But that can be fiddly to set up!
And nowadays, thanks to containerization, we can do better.
Because containerization is a kind of even-more-virtual virtualization.

Conceptually, "regular" virtualization works at the hardware level,
it gives you multiple virtual machines (VMs)
that pretend to be physical computers, on a single real machine.
So you can run multiple operating systems inside separate VMs
on the same physical box.

Containers work at the operating system level.
It gives you multiple virtual operating systems that
all run on a single real OS.
So you can run multiple programs inside separate virtual operating systems,
using a single real host operating system and kernel.

The upshot of this is that containers are much "cheaper".
You can start one up in milliseconds,
and you can run hundreds on the same machine.


==== Containers and your CV

That's all well and good for the _theoretical_ justification.
But let's get to the _real_ reason for using this technology,
which, as always, is:
"it's fashionable so it's going to look good on my CV."

For the purposes of this book,
that's not such a bad justification really.
Yes I think it's going to be a nice way to have a "pretend"
deployment on our own machine, before we try the real one.

But also, containers are so popular nowadays,
that it's very likely that you're going to encounter them at work
(if you haven't already).
For many working developers,
a container image is the final artifact of their work,
it's what they "deliver",
and most of the rest of the deployment process
is taken care of by someone else.


=== Docker and the danger areas of deployment

(TODO: expand this section, is just bullet points atm)

How will containerizing our software help with the danger areas?

* Containers are like a little virtual server,
  so they will force us to address many of the problems
  like dependency management and configuration.

* We can use the containers to package up as much
  of the functionality of our application as possible,
  which in turn will minimise the amount of configuration
  we need to do to our actual servers

* We can test our containers work by running our functional tests
  against them.

* Later, when we deploy our containers to a staging site,
  we can run the FTs against that too.

* If we automate container creation and deployment to staging,
  and we've tested both those things, then we will have
  minimised the risk of deployment to production.

////
old content follows. is there anything we want to rescue from here?

But there are solutions to all of these.  In order:

((("staging sites", "benefits of")))
*   Using a 'staging site', on the same infrastructure as the production site,
    can help us test out our deployments and get things right before we go to
    the "real" site.


*   We can also 'run our functional tests against the staging site'. That will
    reassure us that we have the right code and packages on the server, and
    since we now have a "smoke test" for our site layout, we'll know that the
    CSS is loaded correctly.


*   ((("virtual environment (virtualenv)", "server-based")))Just
    like on our own PC, a 'virtualenv' is useful on the server for
    managing packages and dependencies when you might be running more than one
    Python [keep-together]#application#.

*   ((("automated deployment", "benefits of")))((("automated deployment", see="also Fabric")))And
    finally, 'automation, automation, automation'.  By using an automated
    script to deploy new versions, and by using the same script to deploy to
    staging [keep-together]#and production#, we can reassure ourselves that staging is as much
    like live as
    [keep-together]#possible#.footnote:[What I'm calling a "staging" server, some people would
    call a "development" server, and some others would also like to distinguish
    "preproduction" servers.  Whatever we call it, the point is to have
    somewhere we can try our code out in an environment that's as similar as
    possible to the real production server.]

=== Our deployment procedure

Over the next few pages I'm going to go through _a_ deployment procedure.
It isn't meant to be the _perfect_ deployment procedure,
so please don't take it as being best practice,
or a recommendation--it's meant to be an illustration,
to show the kinds of issues involved in deployment,
and where testing fits in.


**This chapter: containerizing our software**

* Adapt our FTs so they can run against a container

* Build a minimal Dockerfile with everything we need to run our site,
  learn how to build and run a container on our machine,
  and run our FTs against it.

* Gradually, incrementally change the container configuration
  to make it production-ready,
  regularly runing the Fts to check we didn't break anything.

// gunicorn, DEBUG=False, secret key, etc


**Next chapter: automated deployment**

* (maybe?) ssh into the server and configure it manually first?
* figure out all the SSH permissions and DNS issues
* we'll use Ansible to build an automated script that can deploy
  our container to staging
* use our FTs to test staging
* then deploy to prodddd



=== As Always, Start with a Test

((("environment variables")))
((("staging sites", "adapting functional tests for", id="SSadapt09")))
Let's adapt our functional tests slightly
so that it can be run against a standalone server,
instead of the one that `LiveServerTestCase` creates for us.
We'll do it by checking for an environment variable
called `TEST_SERVER`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py (ch08l001)
====
[source,python]
----
import os
[...]

class NewVisitorTest(StaticLiveServerTestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.browser = webdriver.Firefox()
        test_server = os.environ.get('TEST_SERVER')  #<1>
        if test_server:
            self.live_server_url = 'http://' + test_server  #<2>
----
====


Do you remember I said that `LiveServerTestCase` had certain limitations?
Well, one is that it always assumes you want to use its own test server, which
it makes available at `self.live_server_url`.  I still want to be able to do
that sometimes, but I also want to be able to selectively tell it not to
bother, and to use a real server instead.

<1> The way I decided to do it is using an environment variable called
    `TEST_SERVER`.

<2> Here's the hack: we replace `self.live_server_url` with the address of
    our "real" server.

We test that said hack hasn't broken anything by running the functional
tests [keep-together]#"normally"#:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]
Ran 3 tests in 8.544s

OK
----

And now we can try them against our docker server URL.


[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=superlists-staging.ottg.eu python manage.py test functional_tests*]

FAILED (errors=3)
----

NOTE: If, on Windows, you see an error saying something like
    "TEST_SERVER is not recognized as a command", it's probably because
    you're not using Git-Bash.  Take another look at the
    &#x201c;<<pre-requisites>>&#x201d; section.

You can see that all the tests are failing, as expected, since I haven't
actually set up my domain yet. Selenium reports that Firefox is seeing an
error and "cannot establish connection to the server" (depending on your
registrar, you might see content from its default landing page instead).


((("", startref="SSadapt09")))The
FT seems to be testing the right things though, so let's commit:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff* # should show changes to functional_tests.py
$ *git commit -am "Hack FT runner to be able to test staging"*
----


TIP: Don't use `export` to set the 'TEST_SERVER' environment variable;
    otherwise, all your subsequent test runs in that terminal will be against
    staging (and that can be very confusing if you're not expecting it).
    Setting it explicitly inline each time you run the FTs is best.



Getting a Domain Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("staging sites", "domain names")))((("domain names")))We're
going to need a couple of domain names at this point in the book--they
can both be subdomains of a single domain.  I'm going to use
'superlists.ottg.eu' and 'superlists-staging.ottg.eu'.
If you don't already own a domain, this is the time to register one! Again,
this is something I really want you to 'actually' do.  If you've never
registered a domain before, just pick any old registrar and buy a cheap one--it
should only cost you $5 or so, and you can even find free ones.
I promise seeing your site on a "real" website will be a thrill.



Manually Provisioning a Server to Host Our Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("staging sites", "manual server provisioning", id="SSserver09")))((("server provisioning", id="seerver09")))We
can separate out "deployment" into two tasks:

- 'Provisioning' a new server to be able to host the code
- 'Deploying' a new version of the code to an existing server

Some people like to use a brand new server for every deployment--it's what we
do at PythonAnywhere.  That's only necessary for larger, more complex sites
though, or major changes to an existing site. For a simple site like ours, it
makes sense to separate the two tasks.  And, although we eventually want both
to be completely automated, we can probably live with a manual provisioning
system for now.

As you go through this chapter, you should be aware that provisioning is
something that varies a lot, and that as a result there are few universal
best practices for deployment.  So, rather than trying to remember the
specifics of what I'm doing here, you should be trying to understand the
rationale, so that you can apply the same kind of thinking in the
specific future circumstances you encounter.


Choosing Where to Host Our Site
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


((("hosting services")))There
are loads of different solutions out there these days, but they broadly
fall into two camps:

- Running your own (possibly virtual) server
- Using a ((("Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS)")))Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS)
  offering like Heroku, OpenShift, or [keep-together]#PythonAnywhere#



((("PythonAnywhere")))Particularly
for small sites, a PaaS offers a lot of advantages, and I would
definitely recommend looking into them.  We're not going to use a PaaS in this
book however, for several reasons.  Firstly, I have a conflict of interest, in
that I think PythonAnywhere is the best, but then again I would say that
because I work there.  Secondly, all the PaaS offerings are quite different,
and the procedures to deploy to each vary a lot--learning about one doesn't
necessarily tell you about the others. Any one of them might radically change their process or business model by the time you get to read this book.

Instead, we'll learn just a tiny bit of good old-fashioned server admin,
including SSH and web server config.  They're unlikely to ever go away, and
knowing a bit about them will get you some respect from all the grizzled
dinosaurs out there.

What I have done is to try to set up a server in such a way that's a bit
like the environment you get from a PaaS, so you should be able to apply the
lessons we learn in the deployment section, no matter what provisioning
solution you choose.



Spinning Up a Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I'm not going to dictate how you do this--whether you choose Amazon AWS,
Rackspace, Digital Ocean, your own server in your own data centre or a
Raspberry Pi in a cupboard under the stairs, any solution should be fine, as
long as:

* Your server is running Ubuntu 18.04 (aka "Bionic/LTS").

* You have root access to it.

* It's on the public internet.

* You can SSH into it.

I'm recommending Ubuntu as a distro because it's easy to get Python 3.6 on it
and it has some specific ways of configuring Nginx, which I'm going to make use
of next.  If you know what you're doing, you can probably get away with using
something else, but you're on your own.

((("Linux servers")))If
you've never started a Linux server before and you have absolutely no idea
where to start, I wrote a
https://github.com/hjwp/Book-TDD-Web-Dev-Python/blob/master/server-quickstart.md[very brief guide on GitHub].


NOTE: ((("getting help")))Some
    people get to this chapter, and are tempted to skip the domain bit,
    and the "getting a real server" bit, and just use a VM on their own PC.
    Don't do this. It's 'not' the same, and you'll have more difficulty
    following the instructions, which are complicated enough as it is.  If
    you're worried about cost, have a look at the link above for free options.


User Accounts, SSH, and Privileges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In these instructions, I'm assuming that you have a nonroot user account set
up that has "sudo" privileges, so whenever we need to do something that
requires root access, we use sudo, and I'm explicit about that in the various
instructions that follow.

My user is called "elspeth", but you can call yours whatever you like!  Just
remember to substitute it in all the places I've hardcoded it below.
See the guide linked above if you need tips on creating a sudo user.




Installing Python 3.6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Python 3", "installation and setup", "on staging sites", tertiary-sortas="staging sites")))As
of the "Bionic Beaver" release, Python 3.6 is now available as standard on
Ubuntu.  Here's how we install it (and make sure that the virtualenv tools are
available too):

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo apt update*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo apt install python3 python3-venv*
----

TIP: Look out for that `elspeth@server` in the command-line listings in this
    chapter. It indicates commands that must be run on the server, as opposed
    to commands you run on your own PC.

And while we're at it, we'll just make sure Git is installed too.

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo apt install git*
----


Configuring Domains for Staging and Live
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We don't want to be messing about with IP addresses all the time, so we should
point our staging and live domains to the server. At my registrar, the control
screens looked a bit like <<registrar-control-screens>>.

[[registrar-control-screens]]
.Domain setup
image::images/twp2_0902.png["Registrar control screens for two domains"]

//TODO: adjust illustration to show "superlists" not "book-example"

((("A-Records")))In
the DNS system, pointing a domain at a specific IP address is called an
"A-Record".  All registrars are slightly different, but a bit of clicking
around should get you to the right screen in yours.  You'll need two A-records:
one for the staging address and one for the live one.  No need to worry about
any other type of record.

DNS records take some time to "propagate" around the world (it's controlled
by a setting called "TTL", Time To Live), so once you've set up your A-record,
you can check its progress on a "propagation checking" service like this one: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/superlists-staging.ottg.eu[].




Deploying Our Code Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("staging sites", "manual code deployment", id="SScode09")))The
next step is to get a basic copy of the staging site up and running.
As we do so, we're starting to move into doing "deployment" rather than
provisioning, so we should be thinking about how we can automate the process as
we go.

NOTE: One rule of thumb for distinguishing provisioning from deployment is
    that you tend to need root permissions for the former, but you don't for
    the latter.


We need a directory for the source to live in.  We'll put it somewhere
in the home folder of our nonroot user; in my case it would be at
'/home/elspeth' (this is likely to be the setup on any shared hosting system,
but you should always run your web apps as a nonroot user, in any case). I'm
going to set up my sites like this:

[role="skipme"]
----
/home/elspeth
├── sites
│   ├── www.live.my-website.com
│   │    ├── db.sqlite3
│   │    ├── manage.py
│   │    ├── [etc...]
│   │    ├── static
│   │    │    ├── base.css
│   │    │    ├── [etc...]
│   │    └── virtualenv
│   │         ├── lib
│   │         ├── [etc...]
│   │
│   ├── www.staging.my-website.com
│   │    ├── db.sqlite3
│   │    ├── [etc...]
----

Each site (staging, live, or any other website) has its own folder, which
will contain a checkout of the source code (managed by git), along with the
database, static files and virtualenv (managed separately).

To get our code onto the server, we'll use Git and go via one of the
code-sharing sites.  If you haven't already, push your code up to GitHub,
BitBucket, GitLab, or similar.  They all have excellent instructions for
beginners on how to do that.


((("Git", "local variables")))Here
are some Bash commands that will set this all up.


[role="server-commands small-code"]
[subs=""]
----
elspeth@server:$ <strong>export SITENAME=superlists-staging.ottg.eu</strong>
# you should replace the URL in the next line with the URL for your own repo
elspeth@server:$ <strong>git clone https://github.com/hjwp/book-example.git ~/sites/$SITENAME</strong>
Resolving deltas: 100% [...]
----

* The `export` command sets up a "local variable" in Bash; a bit like the
  inline environment variable we used earlier, but it's available to all
  subsequent commands in that same shell.

* `git clone` takes your repo URL as its first argument, and an (optional)
   destination as its second argument.  That will create the target folder
   for us and get our code into the right place in one go.


NOTE: A Bash variable defined using `export` only lasts as long as that console
    session. If you log out of the server and log back in again, you'll need to
    redefine it. It's devious because Bash won't error, it will just substitute
    the empty string for the variable, which will lead to weird results...if in
    doubt, do a quick *`echo $SITENAME`*.


Now we've got the code, let's just try running the dev server, and
see how far we get:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *cd ~/sites/$SITENAME*
$ *python3.7 manage.py runserver*
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "manage.py", line 8, in <module>
    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'
[...]
Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and available on your
PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you forget to activate a virtual
environment?
----

Ah. Django isn't installed on the server.



Creating a Virtualenv on the Server Using requirements.txt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("requirements.txt")))((("virtual environment (virtualenv)")))Just
like on our own machine, a virtualenv is useful on the server to make
sure we have full control over the packages installed for a particular
project.  It can also let us run different projects with different (or
conflicting) dependencies on the same server.

To reproduce our local virtualenv, we can "save" the list of packages we're
using by creating a 'requirements.txt' file. Back on our own machine:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *echo "django==1.11.13" > requirements.txt*
$ *git add requirements.txt*
$ *git commit -m "Add requirements.txt for virtualenv"*
----

NOTE: You may be wondering why we didn't add our other dependency,
    Selenium, to our requirements.  The reason is that Selenium is
    only a dependency for the tests, not the application code (we're
    never going to run the tests on the server itself).  Some
    people like to also create a file called 'test-requirements.txt'.

Now we do a `git push` to send our updates up to our code-sharing site:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git push*
----

And we can pull those changes down to the server:

[role="server-commands skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *git pull*  # may ask you to do some git config first
----


We create our virtualenv just like we did on our own machine:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *pwd*
/home/elspeth/sites/superlists-staging.ottg.eu
elspeth@server:$ *python3.7 -m venv virtualenv*
elspeth@server:$ *ls .venv/bin*
activate      activate.fish  easy_install-3.6  pip3    python   python3.7
activate.csh  easy_install   pip               pip3.6  python3
----

If we wanted to activate the virtualenv, we could do so with
`source ./.venv/bin/activate` just like we do locally, but on the
server we don't need that. We can actually do everything we want to by directly
calling the versions of Python, pip, and the other executables in the
virtualenv's 'bin' directory, as we'll soon see.

For example, to install our requirements into the virtualenv, we use the
virtualenv pip:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *./.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt*
Collecting django==1.11.13 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
[...]
Successfully installed django-1.11.13 pytz-2018.4
----


And to run Python in the virtualenv, we use the virtualenv `python`
binary:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *./.venv/bin/python manage.py runserver*

Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
----

If we ignore the ominous message about migrations for now, Django
certainly looks a lot happier.


Progress!  We've got a system for getting code to and from the server
(`git push` and `git pull`), we've got a virtualenv set up to match our local
one, and a single file, 'requirements.txt', to keep them in sync.



Using the FT to Check That Our Deployment Works
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's see what our FTs think about this version of our site running on
the server. I'll use the `--failfast` option to exit as soon as a single test
fails:


[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=superlists-staging.ottg.eu ./manage.py test functional_tests \
    --failfast*]
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: Reached error page: [...]
----

Nope!  What's going on here?  Time for a little debugging.


Debugging a Deployment That Doesn't Seem to Work at All
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may remember that Django's runserver usually chooses to run on port 8000.
But a "normal" web server should run on port 80, and that's where our FTs are
currently looking, on 'superlists-staging.ottg.eu'.

But we can actually use our `TEST_SERVER` variable to point the tests at
port 8000. Let's try that:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=superlists-staging.ottg.eu:8000 ./manage.py test functional_tests \
    --failfast*]

selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: Reached error page: [...]
----

Nope, that didn't work earlier.  Let's try an even lower-level smoke test, the
traditional Unix utility "curl" -- it's a command-line tool for making web
requests.  Try it on your own computer first:

[role='ignore-errors']
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *curl superlists-staging.ottg.eu*
curl: (7) Failed to connect to superlists-staging.ottg.eu port 80: Connection
refused
----

And maybe just to be sure, we could even open up our web browser and type in
'http://superlists-staging.ottg.eu:8000', and confirm using a familiar tool
that things aren't working. Nope.


.On Debugging
*******************************************************************************
Let me let you in on a little secret.  I'm actually bad at debugging.  We all
have our psychological strengths and weakness, and one of my weaknesses is that
when I run into a problem I can't see an obvious solution to, I want to throw
up my hands way too soon and say "well, this is hopeless, it can't be fixed",
and give up.

Thankfully I have some good role models at work who are much better at it than
me (hi Glenn!).   Debugging needs the patience and tenacity of a bloodhound.
If at first you don't succeed, you need to systematically rule out options,
check your assumptions, eliminate various aspects of the problem and simplify
things down, find the parts that do and don't work, until you eventually find
the cause.

It always seems hopeless at first!  But eventually you get there.

*******************************************************************************

We're pretty sure the server is running and listening on port 8000, but we
can't get to it from the outside.  What about from the inside?  Try
running `curl` on the server itself (you'll need a second SSH shell onto your
server, so as not to interrupt the existing `runserver` process):


[role="server-commands small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *curl localhost:8000*
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>

    [...]
    <title>To-Do lists</title>
    [...]

  </body>
</html>
----

Ah-ha!  That looks like the HTML for our site.  So we 'can' reach it from the
server itself, just not from the outside.  What could be going on?


Actually there's clue in the output that Django printed out earlier when
we ran `runserver`:


[role="skipme small-code"]
----
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
----

Django's development server is configured to listen on 127.0.0.1,
aka the "localhost" IP address.  But we're trying to reach it from
the outside, via the server's "real" public address.


But Django isn't listening on that address by default.
Here's how we tell it to listen on all addresses.  Use Ctrl-C to
interrupt the `runserver` process, and restart it like this:


[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *./.venv/bin/python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000*
[...]
Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
----


And in a second SSH shell, we can confirm it works from the server:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *curl localhost:8000*
<!DOCTYPE html>
[...]
</html>
----

What about from our own laptop?

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *curl superlists-staging.ottg.eu:8000*
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
[...]
</body>
</html>
----

Looks good at first glance!  Let's try our FTs again:


[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=superlists-staging.ottg.eu:8000 ./manage.py test functional_tests \
    --failfast*]

----

NOTE: At this point, if your FTs still can't talk to the server,
    something else must be in the way.  Check your provider's firewall
    settings, and make sure ports 80 and 8000 are open to the world. On AWS,
    for example, you may need to configure the "security group" for your
    server.

Oops, spoke too soon!  Another error.  We didn't look closely enough at
that `curl` pass:[<span class="keep-together">output</span>]...


Hacking ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't be disheartened!  We may have just fixed one problem only to run straight
into another, but this problem is definitely a much easier one.  At least we
can talk to the server!  And it's giving us a helpful pointer.  Try opening the
site manually (<<django-disallowedhosts-error>>):

[[django-disallowedhosts-error]]
.Another hitch along the way
image::images/twp2_0902a.png["the Django debug page explaining the DisallowedHost error"]


`ALLOWED_HOSTS` is a security setting designed to reject requests that are
likely to be forged, broken or malicious because they don't appear to be
asking for your site (HTTP request contain the address they were intended for
in a header called "Host").

By default, when DEBUG=True, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` effectively allows _localhost_,
our own machine, so that's why it was working OK in dev, and from the server
itself (where we ask for 'localhost'), but not from our own machine (where we
ask for 'superlists-staging.ottg.eu')

There's more information in the http://bit.ly/2u0R2d6[Django docs].

The upshot is that we need to adjust `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in 'settings.py'. Since
we're just hacking for now, let's set it to the totally insecure allow-everyone
"*" setting:

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py
====
[source,python]
----
# SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
DEBUG = True

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
[...]
----
====


We commit that locally, then push it up to GitHub...

[subs=""]
----
$ <strong>git commit -am "hack ALLOWED_HOSTS to be *"</strong>
$ <strong>git push</strong>
----

And pull it down on the server, and restart our `runserver` process:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *git pull*
elspeth@server:$ *./.venv/bin/python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000*
----

A quick visual inspection confirms--the site is up (<<staging-is-up>>)!

[[staging-is-up]]
.The staging site is up!
image::images/twp2_0903.png["The front page of the site, at least, is up"]


Let's see what our functional tests say:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=superlists-staging.ottg.eu:8000 ./manage.py test functional_tests \
    --failfast*]
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: [id="id_list_table"]
----


The tests are failing as soon as they try to submit a new item, because we
haven't set up the database. You'll probably have spotted the yellow Django
debug page (<<django-debug-screen>>) telling us as much as the tests went
through, or if you tried it manually.


NOTE: The tests saved us from potential embarrassment there.  The site 'looked'
    fine when we loaded its front page.  If we'd been a little hasty and only
    testing manually, we might have thought we were done, and it would have
    been the first users that discovered that nasty Django DEBUG page.  Okay,
    slight exaggeration for effect, maybe we 'would' have checked, but what
    happens as the site gets bigger and more complex? You can't check
    everything. The tests can.

[[django-debug-screen]]
.But the database isn't
image::images/twp2_0904.png["Django DEBUG page showing database error"]




Creating the Database with migrate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("database migrations")))We
run `migrate` using the `--noinput` argument to suppress the two little "are
you sure" prompts:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *./.venv/bin/python manage.py migrate --noinput*
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: auth, contenttypes, lists, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  [...]
  Applying lists.0004_item_list... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
----

That looks good.  We restart the server:


[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *./.venv/bin/python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000*
----

And try the FTs again:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*TEST_SERVER=superlists-staging.ottg.eu:8000 ./manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]

...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 10.718s

OK
----

Hooray, that's a working deploy!

Time for a well-earned tea break I think, and perhaps a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_biscuit[chocolate biscuit].


Success!  Our Hack Deployment Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Phew.  Well, it took a bit of hacking about, but now we can be reassured that
the basic piping works. Notice that the FT was able to guide us incrementally
towards a working site.

But we really can't be using the Django dev server in production, or running on
port 8000 forever. In the next chapter, we'll make our hacky deployment more
production-ready.((("", startref="DEPstage09")))



.Test-Driving Server Configuration and Deployment
*******************************************************************************

Tests take some of the uncertainty out of deployment::
    ((("staging sites", "benefits of")))For
    developers, server administration is always "fun", by which I mean, a
    process full of uncertainty and surprises. My aim during this chapter was
    to show that a functional test suite can take some of the uncertainty out
    of the process.

Some typical pain points--networking, ports, static files, and the database::
    The things that you need to keep an eye out for on any deployment include
    making sure your database configuration, static files, software
    dependencies, and custom settings that differ between development and
    production.  You'll need to think through each of these for your own
    deployments.

Tests allow us to experiment and work incrementally::
    Whenever we make a change to our server configuration, we can rerun the
    test suite, and be confident that everything works as well as it did
    before.  It allows us to experiment with our setup with less fear (as
    we'll see in the next chapter).
