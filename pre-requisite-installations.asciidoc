Prerequisites and Assumptions
------------------------------

((("prerequisite knowledge", id="prereq00")))((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "prerequisite knowledge assumed", id="TDDprereq00")))Here's
an outline of what I'm assuming about you and what you already know,
as well as what software you'll need ready and installed on your computer.


Python 3.7 and Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Python 3", "introductory books on")))I've
tried to write this book with beginners in mind, but if you're new to
programming, I'm assuming that you've already learned the basics of Python. So
if you haven't already, do run through a Python beginner's tutorial or get an
introductory book like http://www.diveintopython.net/['Dive Into Python']  or
http://learnpythonthehardway.org/['Learn Python the Hard Way'], or, just for
fun, http://inventwithpython.com/['Invent Your Own Computer Games with
Python'], all of which are excellent introductions.

If you're an experienced programmer but new to Python, you should get along
just fine.  Python is joyously simple to understand.

I'm using 'Python 3' for this book. When I wrote the first edition in 2013&ndash;14, Python 3
had been around for several years, and the world was just about on the tipping
point at which it was the preferred choice.  You should be able to follow this
book on Mac, Windows, or Linux.  Detailed installation instructions for each OS
follow.

TIP: This book was tested against Python 3.6 and 3.7. If you're on an earlier
    version, you will find minor differences (the f-string syntax, for
    example), so you're best off upgrading if you can.

((("Python 3", "vs. Python 2", secondary-sortas="Python 2")))I
wouldn't recommend trying to use Python 2, as the differences are more
substantial. You'll still be able to carry across all the lessons you learn
in this book if your next project happens to be in Python 2.  But spending
time figuring out whether the reason your program output looks different from
mine is because of Python 2, or because you made an actual mistake, won't be
time spent productively.

((("PythonAnywhere")))If
you are thinking of using http://www.pythonanywhere.com[PythonAnywhere] (the
PaaS startup I work for), rather than a locally installed Python, you should go
and take a quick look at <<appendix1>> before you get started.

In any case, I expect you to have access to Python, to know how to launch it
from a command line, and to know how to edit a Python file and run it.  Again,
have a look at the three books I recommended previously if you're in any doubt.

NOTE: If you already have Python 2 installed, and you're worried that
    installing Python 3 will break it in some way, don't!  Python 3 and 2 can
    coexist peacefully on the same system, particularly if you're using
    a virtualenv, which we will be.


How HTML Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("HTML", "tutorials")))I'm
also assuming you have a basic grasp of how the web works--what HTML is,
what a POST request is, and so on.  If you're not sure about those, you'll need to
find a basic HTML tutorial; there are a few at http://www.webplatform.org/.  If
you can figure out how to create an HTML page on your PC and look at it in your
browser, and understand what a form is and how it might work, then you're
probably OK.


Django
~~~~~~

((("Django framework", "tutorials")))The
book uses the Django framework, which is (probably) the most
well-established web framework in the Python world.  I've written the book
assuming that the reader has no prior knowledge of Django, but if you're
new to Python 'and' new to web development 'and' new to testing,  you may
occasionally find that there's just one too many topics and sets of concepts
to try and take on board.  If that's the case, I recommend taking a break from
the book, and taking a look at a Django tutorial.
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/[DjangoGirls] is the best, most
beginner-friendly tutorial I know of.  The
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/[official tutorial]
is also excellent for more experienced programmers (make sure you follow the
1.11 tutorial rather than a 2.x one though).

.Don't use Django 2
*******************************************************************************
This book was published before Django 2.0 came out, and as such is
written for Django v1.11 (which is a "long-term-support" or LTS edition).

Now I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking, come on, what's the
point in learning an old version, I may as well learn the latest one,
I'll follow along with Django 2 and just figure it out for myself when
things are different.  How hard can it be?  I know you're thinking this
because it's exactly what I'd be thinking.

Actually, it's never _that_ hard.  But look, this is not a short book,
there's a lot of code to follow along with, and at several points I
_guarantee_ you are going to be staring at something on your screen that
looks nothing like what I say it should in the book.  At those points,
it's hard enough debugging all the moving parts for any mistakes you
might have made, without having to add in the extra possibility that
it's something to do with Django 2 vs Django 1.11.

So my strong recommendation is, stick with 1.11.  The new version is
not that different, and if you need to learn Django 2 for your next project,
it'll take you all of 2 hours to go through the official tutorial. Plus if you
get stuck and you're on Django 2, I won't be able to help you.
*******************************************************************************

Read on for installation instructions.


JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~

There's a little bit of JavaScript in the second half of the book.  If you
don't know JavaScript, don't worry about it until then, and if you find
yourself a little confused, I'll recommend a couple of guides at that point.

.A Note on IDEs
*******************************************************************************
((("integrated development environments (IDEs) ")))If
you've come from the world of Java or .NET, you may be keen to use an IDE
for your Python coding.  They have all sorts of useful tools, including VCS
integration, and there are some excellent ones out there for Python.  I used
one myself when I was starting out, and I found it very useful for my first
couple of projects.

Can I suggest (and it's only a suggestion) that you _don't_ use an IDE, at
least for the duration of this tutorial? IDEs are much less necessary in the
Python world, and I've written this whole book with the assumption that you're
just using a basic text editor and a command line.  Sometimes, that's all you
have--when you're working on a server, for example--so it's always worth
learning how to use the basic tools first and understanding how they work.
It'll be something you always have, even if you decide to go back to your IDE
and all its helpful tools, after you've finished this book.
*******************************************************************************


Required Software Installations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("software requirements", id="soft00")))Aside
from Python, you'll need:

The Firefox web browser::
    ((("Firefox", "benefits of")))Selenium
can actually drive any of the major browsers, but Firefox is the
    best to use as an example because it's reliably cross-platform and, as a
    bonus, is less sold out to corporate interests.


The Git version control system::
    ((("Git", "downloading")))This
is available for any platform, at http://git-scm.com/.   On Windows,
    this comes with the _Bash_ command line, which is needed for the book.


A virtualenv with Python 3, Django 1.11, and Selenium 3 in it::
    Python's virtualenv and pip tools now come bundled with Python 3.4+ (they
    didn't always used to, so this is a big hooray).  Detailed instructions for
    preparing your virtualenv follow.


Geckodriver::
    This is the driver that will let us remotely control Firefox via
    Selenium.  I'll point to a download link in <<firefox_gecko>>.

.Windows Notes
*******************************************************************************
((("Windows", "tips")))((("Python 3", "installation and setup", "Windows installation")))Windows
users can sometimes feel a little neglected in the open source world,
since macOS and Linux are so prevalent, making it easy to forget there's a world
outside the Unix paradigm.  Backslashes as directory separators?  Drive
letters?  What?   Still, it is absolutely possible to follow along with this
book on Windows.  Here are a few tips:

1. When you install Git for Windows, make sure you choose *"Run Git and
    included Unix tools from the Windows command prompt"*. You'll then get
    access to a program called "Git Bash". Use this as your main command prompt
    and you'll get all the useful GNU command-line tools like `ls`, `touch`,
    and `grep`, plus forward-slash directory separators.

2. Also in the Git installer, choose *"Use Windows' default console"*;
    otherwise, Python won't work properly in the Git-Bash window.

3. When you install Python 3, unless you already have Python 2 and want to keep
    it as your default, tick the option that says *"Add Python 3.7 to PATH"* as
    in <<add-python-to-path>>, so that you can easily run Python from the
    command line.

[[add-python-to-path]]
.Add Python to the system path from the installer
image::images/twp2_0001.png["Screenshot of python installer"]

TIP: The test for all this is that you should be able to go to a Git-Bash
    command prompt and just run `python` or `pip` from any folder.

*******************************************************************************


.MacOS Notes
*******************************************************************************
((("MacOS")))((("Python 3", "installation and setup", "MacOS installation")))MacOS
is a bit more sane than Windows, although getting `pip` installed was
still fairly challenging up until recently. Since the arrival of 3.4, things
are now quite [keep-together]#straightforward#:

* Python 3.7 should install without a fuss from its
  http://www.python.org[downloadable installer].  It will automatically install
  `pip`, too.

* Git's installer should also "just work".

Similarly to Windows, the test for all this is that you should be able to open
a terminal and just run `git`, `python3`, or `pip` from anywhere.  If you run
into any trouble, the search terms "system path" and "command not found" should
provide good troubleshooting resources.

TIP: You might also want to check out http://brew.sh//[Homebrew]. It used to be
    the only reliable way of installing lots of Unixy tools (including Python
    3) on a Mac.footnote:[I wouldn't recommend installing Firefox via Homebrew
    though: `brew` puts the Firefox binary in a strange location, and it
    confuses Selenium. You can work around it, but it's simpler to just install
    Firefox in the normal way.]
    Although the normal Python installer is now fine, you may find Homebrew
    useful in future. It does require you to download all 1.1 GB of Xcode, but
    that also gives you a C compiler, which is a useful side effect.

.Linux Notes
*******************************************************************************

If you're on Linux, I'm assuming you're already a glutton for punishment,
so you don't need detailed installation instructions. But in brief, if Python
3.6/3.7 isn't available directly from your package manager:

* If you're on an older Ubuntu that doesn't have 3.7, I recommend the
  https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa[Deadsnakes PPA].
  Make sure you `apt install python3.7-venv` as well as just `python3.7` to
  un-break the default Debian version of Python.

* Alternatively, compiling Python 3.7 from source is actually surprisingly
  easy!

*******************************************************************************



[[git-default-editor]]
Git's Default Editor, and Other Basic Git Config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Git", "configuring")))I'll
provide step-by-step instructions for Git, but it may be a good idea to
get a bit of configuration done now.  For example, when you do your first
commit, by default 'vi' will pop up, at which point you may have no idea what
to do with it. Well, much as vi has two modes, you then have two choices. One
is to learn some minimal vi commands '(press the i key to go into insert mode,
type your text, press `<Esc>` to go back to normal mode, then write the file
and quit with `:wq<Enter>`)'. You'll then have joined the great fraternity of
people who know this ancient, revered text editor.

Or you can point-blank refuse to be involved in such a ridiculous throwback to
the 1970s, and configure Git to use an editor of your choice. Quit vi using
`<Esc>` followed by `:q!`, then change your Git default editor. See the Git
documentation on
http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration[basic Git configuration].


[[firefox_gecko]]
Installing Firefox and Geckodriver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("Firefox", "installing")))((("Geckodriver", "installing")))Firefox
is available as a download for Windows and macOS from
https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/.  On Linux, you probably already have it
installed, but otherwise your package manager will have it.

Geckodriver is available from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases.
You need to download and extract it and put it somewhere on your system path.

* For Windows, you can just put it in the same folder as your code for this
  book—or if you put it in your Python _Scripts_ folder, it'll be available
  for other projects.
* For macOS or Linux, one convenient place to put it is _/usr/local/bin_
  (you'll need `sudo` for this).

To test that you've got this working, open up a Bash console and you should be
able to run:

[subs=quotes]
----
$ *geckodriver --version*
geckodriver 0.21.0

Setting Up Your Virtualenv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Python 3", "installation and setup", "virtualenv set up and activation", id="P3installvirt00")))((("virtual environment (virtualenv)", "installation and setup", id="VEinstall00")))((("", startref="soft00")))A
Python virtualenv (short for virtual environment) is how you set up your
environment for different Python projects.  It allows you to use different
packages (e.g., different versions of Django, and even different versions of
Python) in each project.  And because you're not installing things
system-wide, it means you don't need root [keep-together]#permissions#.

Let's create a Python 3 virtualenv. I'm assuming you're working in a folder
called _python-tdd-book_, but you can name your work folder whatever you like.
Stick to the name "virtualenv" for the virtualenv, though.

[subs=quotes]
.on Windows:
----
$ *cd python-tdd-book*
$ *py -3.7 -m venv virtualenv*
----

On Windows, the `py` executable is a shortcut for different Python versions.  On
Mac or Linux, we use `python3.7`:


[subs=quotes]
.on Mac/Linux:
----
$ *cd python-tdd-book*
$ *python3.7 -m venv virtualenv*
----



Activating and Deactivating the Virtualenv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whenever you work on the book, you'll want to make sure your virtualenv has
been "activated".  You can always tell when your virtualenv is active because
you'll see `(virtualenv)` in parentheses, in your prompt.  But you can
also check by running `which python` to check whether Python is currently
the system-installed one, or the virtualenv one.

The command to activate the virtualenv is `source virtualenv/Scripts/activate` on
Windows and `source virtualenv/bin/activate` on Mac/Linux. The command to
deactivate is just `deactivate`.


Try it out like this:


[subs=quotes]
.on Windows
----
$ *source virtualenv/Scripts/activate*
(virtualenv)$
(virtualenv)$ *which python*
/C/Users/harry/python-tdd-book/virtualenv/Scripts/python
(virtualenv)$ *deactivate*
$
$ *which python*
/c/Users/harry/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python36-32/python
----


[subs=quotes]
.on Mac/Linux
----
$ *source virtualenv/bin/activate*
(virtualenv)$
(virtualenv)$ *which python*
/home/myusername/python-tdd-book/virtualenv/bin/python
(virtualenv)$ *deactivate*
$
$ *which python*
/usr/bin/python
----


TIP: Always make sure your virtualenv is active when working on the book. Look
    out for the `(virtualenv)` in your prompt, or run `which python` to check.


.Activate Not Working on Windows?
*******************************************************************************

((("troubleshooting", "virtualenv activation")))If 
you see an error like this:

----
bash: virtualenv/Scripts/activate: No such file or directory
----

First, double-check you're in the right folder.  Assuming you are,
or if you see an error like this:

[role="small-code"]
----
bash: @echo: command not found
bash: virtualenv/Scripts/activate.bat: line 4: 
      syntax error near unexpected token `(
bash: virtualenv/Scripts/activate.bat: line 4: `if not defined PROMPT ('
----

Then you've probably run into a old bug where Python wouldn't install an
activate script that was compatible with Git-Bash. Reinstall the latest Python
3, making sure you have 3.6.3 or later, then delete and re-create your
virtualenv.

*******************************************************************************


Installing Django and Selenium
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Django framework", "installation")))((("Selenium", "installation")))We'll
install Django 1.11 and the latest Selenium, Selenium 3.

Remember to make sure your virtualenv is active first!

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
(virtualenv) $ *pip install "django<1.12" "selenium<4"*
Collecting django==1.11.20
  Using cached Django-1.11.20-py2.py3-none-any.whl

Successfully installed django-1.11.20 selenium-3.14.1
----


Some Error Messages You're Likely to See When You 'Inevitably' Fail to Activate Your Virtualenv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("troubleshooting", "virtualenv activation")))If
you're new to virtualenvs--or even if you're not, to be honest--at some
point you're 'guaranteed' to forget to activate it, and then you'll be
staring at an error message.  Happens to me all the time.  Here are some of the
things to look out for:

----
ImportError: No module named selenium
----

Or:

----
ImportError: No module named django.core.management
----

As always, look out for that `(virtualenv)` in your command prompt, and a
quick `source virtualenv/Scripts/activate` or `source
virtualenv/bin/activate` is probably what you need to get it working again.



Here's a couple more, for good measure:

----
bash: virtualenv/Scripts/activate: No such file or directory
----

This means you're not currently in the right directory for working on the
project.  Try a `cd tdd-python-book`, or similar.

Alternatively, if you're sure you're in the right place, you may have run into
a bug from an older version of Python, where it wouldn't install
an activate script that was compatible with Git-Bash.  Reinstall Python 3, and
make sure you have version 3.6.3 or later, and then delete and re-create your
virtualenv.

If you see something like this, it's probably the same issue, you need to
upgrade Python:

----
bash: @echo: command not found
bash: virtualenv/Scripts/activate.bat: line 4: 
      syntax error near unexpected token `(
bash: virtualenv/Scripts/activate.bat: line 4: `if not defined PROMPT ('
----


Final one!  If you see this:

----
'source' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
----

It's because you've launched the default Windows command prompt, +cmd+,
instead of Git-Bash.  Close it and open the latter.


.On Anaconda
*******************************************************************************
Anaconda is another tool for managing different Python environments.  It's
particularly popular on Windows and for scientific computing, where it can
be hard to get some of the compiled libraries to install.

In the world of web programming it's much less necessary, so _I recommend you do not use Anaconda for this book_.

Apart from anything else I don't know enough about it to help you debug any
problems with it if they occur!
