== Source Code Examples

((("code examples, obtaining and using")))
All
of the code examples I've used in the book are available in
https://github.com/hjwp/book-example/[my repo on GitHub].
So, if you ever want to compare your code against mine,
you can take a look at it there.

Each chapter has its own branch named after it, like so:
https://github.com/hjwp/book-example/tree/chapter_01.

Be aware that each branch contains all of the commits for that chapter,
so its state represents the code at the 'end' of the chapter.

=== Using Git to Check Your Progress

If you feel like developing your Git-Fu a little further, you can add
my repo as a 'remote':

[role="skipme"]
-----
git remote add harry https://github.com/hjwp/book-example.git
git fetch harry
-----

And then, to check your difference from the 'end' of <<chapter_04_philosophy_and_refactoring>>:

[role="skipme"]
----
git diff harry/chapter_04_philosophy_and_refactoring
----

Git can handle multiple remotes, so you can still do this even if you're
already pushing your code up to GitHub or Bitbucket.

Be aware that the precise order of, say, methods in a class may differ
between your version and mine.  It may make diffs hard to read.


=== Downloading a ZIP File for a Chapter

If, for whatever reason, you want to "start from scratch" for a chapter,
or skip ahead,footnote:[
I don't recommend skipping ahead.
I haven't designed the chapters to stand on their own;
each relies on the previous ones, so it may be more confusing than anything else...]
and/or you're just not comfortable with Git,
you can download a version of my code as a ZIP file,
from URLs following this pattern:

https://github.com/hjwp/book-example/archive/chapter_01.zip

https://github.com/hjwp/book-example/archive/chapter_04_philosophy_and_refactoring.zip


=== Don't Let it Become a Crutch!

Try not to sneak a peek at the answers unless you're really, really stuck.
Like I said at the beginning of <<chapter_03_unit_test_first_view>>,
there's a lot of value in debugging errors all by yourself,
and in real life, there's no "harrys repo" to check against
and find all the answers.

Happy coding!
