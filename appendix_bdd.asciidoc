[appendix]
== Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)


.Warning, Content From Second Edition
*******************************************************************************
This appendix is from the second edition of the book,
so the listings have not been updated for the latest versions
of Django and Python.

As always, feedback is welcome, but especially-especially
since this stuff is all so new.
Let me know how you get on :)

*******************************************************************************

Now I haven't used BDD for more than a few weeks in a production project,
so I can't claim any deep expertise.
But, I did like what I have seen of it,
and I thought that you deserved at least a whirlwind tour.

In this appendix, we'll take some of the tests we wrote in a
"normal" FT, and convert them to using BDD tools.

=== What Is BDD?

((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", "defined")))
((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", id="bdd31")))
BDD, _strictly_ speaking, is a practice rather than a toolset--it's
the approach of testing your application by testing the _behaviour_ that we expect it
to display to a user (the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development[Wikipedia entry]
has quite a good overview).
So, in some ways, the Selenium-based FTs that I've
shown in the rest of the book _could_ be called BDD.

NOTE: When people say "you should test behaviour, not implementation",
    they're essentially advocating for BDD as a practice.

==== Gherkin and Cucumber

((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", "tools for")))
((("Gherkin", id="gherkin31")))
((("Cucumber")))
But the term has become closely associated with a particular set of tools
for doing BDD, and particularly the
https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin[Gherkin syntax],
which is a human-readable DSL for writing functional (or acceptance) tests.
Gherkin originally came out of the Ruby world,
where it's associated with a test runner called http://cukes.info/[Cucumber].


TIP:  BDD as a practice is not the same as the toolset and the Gherkin syntax

((("Lettuce")))
((("Behave")))
In the Python world, we have a couple of equivalent test running tools,
http://lettuce.it/[Lettuce] and http://pythonhosted.org/behave/[Behave].
Of these, only Behave was compatible with Python 3 at the time of writing,
so that's what we'll use.
We'll also use a plugin called
https://pythonhosted.org/behave-django/[behave-django].


[role="pagebreak-before"]
.Getting the Code for These Examples
**********************************************************************

((("code examples, obtaining and using")))
I'm going to use the example from <<chapter_24_outside_in>>.
We have a basic to-do lists site, and we want to add a new feature:
logged-in users should be able to view the lists they've authored in one place.
Up until this point, all lists are effectively anonymous.

If you've been following along with the book, I'm going to assume you can skip
back to the code for that point.  If you want to pull it from my repo, the
place to go is the
https://github.com/hjwp/book-example/tree/chapter_17[chapter_17 branch].

**********************************************************************


=== Basic Housekeeping

((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", "directory creation")))We
make a directory for our BDD "features," add a _steps_ directory (we'll find
out what these are shortly!), and placeholder for our first feature:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *mkdir -p features/steps*
$ *touch features/my_lists.feature*
$ *touch features/steps/my_lists.py*
$ *tree features*
features
├── my_lists.feature
└── steps
    └── my_lists.py
----


We install `behave-django`, and add it to _settings.py_:


[role="dofirst-ch35l000"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip install behave-django*
----

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py

     'accounts',

====

And then run `python manage.py behave` as a sanity check:

=== Writing an FT as a "Feature" Using Gherkin Syntax

((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", "functional test using Gherkin syntax")))
((("functional tests (FTs)", "using Gherkin syntax", secondary-sortas="Gherkin syntax")))
Up until now, we've been writing our FTs using human-readable comments
that describe the new feature in terms of a user story, interspersed
with the Selenium code required to execute each step in the story.

BDD enforces a distinction between those two--we write our human-readable
story using a human-readable (if occasionally somewhat awkward) syntax
called "Gherkin", and that is called the "Feature".  Later, we'll map
each line of Gherkin to a function that contains the Selenium code necessary
to implement that "step."

Here's what a Feature for our new "My lists" page could look like:

[role="sourcecode"]
.features/my_lists.feature
====
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: My Lists
    As a logged-in user
    I want to be able to see all my lists in one page
    So that I can find them all after I've written them

    Scenario: Create two lists and see them on the My Lists page

        Given I am a logged-in user

        When I create a list with first item "Reticulate Splines"
            And I add an item "Immanentize Eschaton"
            And I create a list with first item "Buy milk"

        Then I will see a link to "My lists"

        When I click the link to "My lists"
        Then I will see a link to "Reticulate Splines"
        And I will see a link to "Buy milk"

        When I click the link to "Reticulate Splines"
        Then I will be on the "Reticulate Splines" list page
----
====

[role="pagebreak-before"]
==== As-a /I want to/So that

At the top you'll notice the As-a/I want to/So that clause.  This is
optional, and it has no executable counterpart--it's just a slightly
formalised way of capturing the "who and why?" aspects of a user story,
gently encouraging the team to think about the justifications for each
feature.


==== Given/When/Then

Given/When/Then is the real core of a BDD test.  This trilobite formulation
matches the setup/exercise/assert pattern we've seen in our unit tests, and
it represents the setup and assumptions phase, an exercise/action phase, and
a subsequent assertion/observation phase.  There's more info on the
https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Given-When-Then[Cucumber wiki].


==== Not Always a Perfect Fit!

As you can see, it's not always easy to shoe-horn a user story into exactly
three steps!  We can use the `And` clause to expand on a step, and I've
added multiple `When` steps and subsequent `Then`'s to illustrate further
aspects of our "My lists" page.((("", startref="gherkin31")))


=== Coding the Step Functions

((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", "step functions")))
We now build the counterpart to our Gherkin-syntax feature,
which are the "step" functions that will actually implement them in code.


==== Generating Placeholder Steps

When we run `behave`, it helpfully tells us about all the steps we need to
implement:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py behave*
Feature: My Lists # features/my_lists.feature:1
  As a logged-in user
  I want to be able to see all my lists in one page
  So that I can find them all after I've written them
  Scenario: Create two lists and see them on the My Lists page  #
features/my_lists.feature:6
    Given I am a logged-in user                                 # None
    Given I am a logged-in user                                 # None
    When I create a list with first item "Reticulate Splines"   # None
    And I add an item "Immanentize Eschaton"                    # None
    And I create a list with first item "Buy milk"              # None
    Then I will see a link to "My lists"                        # None
    When I click the link to "My lists"                         # None
    Then I will see a link to "Reticulate Splines"              # None
    And I will see a link to "Buy milk"                         # None
    When I click the link to "Reticulate Splines"               # None
    Then I will be on the "Reticulate Splines" list page        # None


Failing scenarios:
  features/my_lists.feature:6  Create two lists and see them on the My Lists
page


0 features passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped
0 scenarios passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped
0 steps passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 10 undefined
Took 0m0.000s

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

@given(u'I am a logged-in user')
def step_impl(context):
    raise NotImplementedError(u'STEP: Given I am a logged-in user')

@when(u'I create a list with first item "Reticulate Splines"')
def step_impl(context):
[...]
----

And you'll notice all this output is nicely coloured, as shown in
<<behave-output>>.

[[behave-output]]
.Behave with coloured console ouptut

image::images/twp2_ae01.png["Colourful console output"]

It's encouraging us to copy and paste these snippets, and use them as
starting points to build our steps.


=== First Step Definition

Here's a first stab at making a step for our "Given I am a logged-in user"
step. I started by stealing the code for `self.create_pre_authenticated_session`
from 'functional_tests/test_my_lists.py', and adapting it slightly (removing
the server-side version, for example, although it would be easy to re-add
later).

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.features/steps/my_lists.py
====
[source,python]
----
from behave import given, when, then
from functional_tests.management.commands.create_session import \
    create_pre_authenticated_session
from django.conf import settings


@given('I am a logged-in user')
def given_i_am_logged_in(context):
    session_key = create_pre_authenticated_session(email='edith@example.com')
    ## to set a cookie we need to first visit the domain.
    ## 404 pages load the quickest!
    context.browser.get(context.get_url("/404_no_such_url/"))
    context.browser.add_cookie(dict(
        name=settings.SESSION_COOKIE_NAME,
        value=session_key,
        path='/',
    ))
----
====
//ch35l004

The 'context' variable needs a little explaining—it's a sort of global
variable, in the sense that it's passed to each step that's executed, and it
can be used to store information that we need to share between steps. Here
we've assumed we'll be storing a browser object on it, and the `server_url`.
We end up using it a lot like we used `self` when we were writing `unittest`
FTs.


=== setUp and tearDown Equivalents in environment.py

Steps can make changes to state in the `context`, but the place to do
preliminary set-up, the equivalent of `setUp`, is in a file called
_environment.py_:


[role="sourcecode"]
.features/environment.py
====
[source,python]
----
from selenium import webdriver

def before_all(context):
    context.browser = webdriver.Firefox()

def after_all(context):
    context.browser.quit()

def before_feature(context, feature):
    pass
----
====
//ch35l005


=== Another Run

As a sanity check, we can do another run, to see if the new step works and
that we really can start a browser:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py behave*
[...]
1 step passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 9 undefined
----

The usual reams of output, but we can see that it seems to have made it through
the first step; let's define the rest of them.


=== Capturing Parameters in Steps

((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", "capturing parameters in steps")))We'll
see how Behave allows you to capture parameters from step descriptions.
Our next step says:

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.features/my_lists.feature
====
[source,gherkin]
----
    When I create a list with first item "Reticulate Splines"
----
====

And the autogenerated step definition looked like this:

[role="sourcecode small-code skipme"]
.features/steps/my_lists.py
====
[source,python]
----
@given('I create a list with first item "Reticulate Splines"')
def step_impl(context):
    raise NotImplementedError(
        u'STEP: When I create a list with first item "Reticulate Splines"'
    )
----
====

We want to be able to create lists with arbitrary first items, so it would be
nice to somehow capture whatever is between those quotes, and pass them in as
an argument to a more generic function.  That's a common requirement in BDD,
and Behave has a nice syntax for it, reminiscent of the new-style Python string
formatting syntax:


[role="sourcecode"]
.features/steps/my_lists.py (ch35l006)
====
[source,python]
----
[...]

@when('I create a list with first item "{first_item_text}"')
def create_a_list(context, first_item_text):
    context.browser.get(context.get_url('/'))
    context.browser.find_element(By.ID, 'id_text').send_keys(first_item_text)
    context.browser.find_element(By.ID, 'id_text').send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
    wait_for_list_item(context, first_item_text)
----
====

Neat, huh?

NOTE: Capturing parameters for steps is one of the most powerful features
    of the BDD syntax.


As usual with Selenium tests, we will need an explicit wait.  Let's re-use
our `@wait` decorator from 'base.py':


[role="sourcecode"]
.features/steps/my_lists.py (ch35l007)
====
[source,python]
----
from functional_tests.base import wait
[...]


@wait
def wait_for_list_item(context, item_text):
    context.test.assertIn(
        item_text,
        context.browser.find_element_by_css_selector('#id_list_table').text
    )
----
====


Similarly, we can add to an existing list, and see or click on links:


[role="sourcecode"]
.features/steps/my_lists.py (ch35l008)
====
[source,python]
----
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
[...]


@when('I add an item "{item_text}"')
def add_an_item(context, item_text):
    context.browser.find_element(By.ID, 'id_text').send_keys(item_text)
    context.browser.find_element(By.ID, 'id_text').send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
    wait_for_list_item(context, item_text)


@then('I will see a link to "{link_text}"')
@wait
def see_a_link(context, link_text):
    context.browser.find_element_by_link_text(link_text)


@when('I click the link to "{link_text}"')
def click_link(context, link_text):
    context.browser.find_element_by_link_text(link_text).click()
----
====

Notice we can even use our `@wait` decorator on steps themselves.


And finally the slightly more complex step that says I am on the
page for a particular list:

[role="sourcecode"]
.features/steps/my_lists.py (ch35l009)
====
[source,python]
----
@then('I will be on the "{first_item_text}" list page')
@wait
def on_list_page(context, first_item_text):
    first_row = context.browser.find_element_by_css_selector(
        '#id_list_table tr:first-child'
    )
    expected_row_text = '1: ' + first_item_text
    context.test.assertEqual(first_row.text, expected_row_text)
----
====

[role="pagebreak-before"]
Now we can run it and see our first expected failure:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py behave*]

Feature: My Lists # features/my_lists.feature:1
  As a logged-in user

    When I create a list with first item "Reticulate Splines"   #

    And I add an item "Immanentize Eschaton"                    #

    And I create a list with first item "Buy milk"              #

      Traceback (most recent call last):

Failing scenarios:
  features/my_lists.feature:6  Create two lists and see them on the My Lists
page

0 features passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped
0 scenarios passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped
4 steps passed, 1 failed, 5 skipped, 0 undefined
----

You can see how the output really gives you a sense of how far through the
"story" of the test we got: we manage to create our two lists successfully, but
the "My lists" link does not appear.


=== Comparing the Inline-Style FT

((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", "comparing inline-style FT")))
I'm not going to run through the implementation of the feature,
but you can see how the test will drive development
just as well as the inline-style FT would have.

Let's have a look at it, for comparison:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.functional_tests/test_my_lists.py
====
[source,python]
----
def test_logged_in_users_lists_are_saved_as_my_lists(self):
    # Edith is a logged-in user
    self.create_pre_authenticated_session('edith@example.com')

    # She goes to the home page and starts a list
    self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
    self.add_list_item('Reticulate splines')
    self.add_list_item('Immanentize eschaton')
    first_list_url = self.browser.current_url

    # She notices a "My lists" link, for the first time.
    self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('My lists').click()

    # She sees that her list is in there, named according to its
    # first list item
    self.wait_for(
        lambda: self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('Reticulate splines')
    )
    self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('Reticulate splines').click()
    self.wait_for(
        lambda: self.assertEqual(self.browser.current_url, first_list_url)
    )

    # She decides to start another list, just to see
    self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
    self.add_list_item('Click cows')
    second_list_url = self.browser.current_url

    # Under "my lists", her new list appears
    self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('My lists').click()
    self.wait_for(
        lambda: self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('Click cows')
    )
    self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('Click cows').click()
    self.wait_for(
        lambda: self.assertEqual(self.browser.current_url, second_list_url)
    )

    # She logs out.  The "My lists" option disappears
    self.browser.find_element_by_link_text('Log out').click()
    self.wait_for(lambda: self.assertEqual(
        self.browser.find_elements_by_link_text('My lists'),
        []
    ))
----
====

It's not entirely an apples-to-apples comparison, but we can look at the
number of lines of code in <<table-code-compare>>.

[[table-code-compare]]
.Lines of code comparison
[options="header"]
|==============================================================================
|BDD                            |Standard FT
|Feature file: 20 (3 optional)  |test function body: 45
|Steps file: 56 lines           |helper functions: 23
|==============================================================================

The comparison isn't perfect, but you might say that the feature file and the
body of a "standard FT" test function are equivalent in that they present the
main "story" of a test, while the steps and helper functions represent the
"hidden" implementation details.  If you add them up, the total numbers are
pretty similar, but notice that they're spread out differently: the BDD tests
have made the story more concise, and pushed more work out into the hidden
implementation details.


=== BDD Encourages Structured Test Code

((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", "structured test code encouraged by")))
((("functional tests (FTs)", "structuring test code")))
This is the real appeal, for me: the BDD tool has _forced_ us to structure our
test code.  In the inline-style FT, we're free to use as many lines as we want
to implement a step, as described by its comment line.  It's very hard to
resist the urge to just copy-and-paste code from elsewhere, or just from
earlier on in the test.   You can see that, by this point in the book, I've
built just a couple of helper functions (like `get_item_input_box`).

In contrast, the BDD syntax has immediately forced me to have a separate
function for each step, so I've already built some very reusable code to:

* Start a new list
* Add an item to an existing list
* Click on a link with particular text
* Assert that I'm looking at a particular list's page

BDD really encourages you to write test code that seems to match well with
the business domain, and to use a layer of abstraction between the story of
your FT and its implementation in code.

The ultimate expression of this is that, theoretically, if you wanted to
change programming languages, you could keep all your features in Gherkin
syntax exactly as they are, and throw away the Python steps and replace them
with steps implemented in another language.


=== The Page Pattern as an Alternative

((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", "page pattern")))
((("page pattern")))
In <<chapter_26_page_pattern>> of the book,
I present an example of the "Page pattern",
which is an object-oriented approach to structuring your Selenium tests.
Here's a reminder of what it looks like:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.functional_tests/test_sharing.py
====
[source,python]
----
from .my_lists_page import MyListsPage
[...]

class SharingTest(FunctionalTest):

    def test_can_share_a_list_with_another_user(self):
        # [...]
        self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
        list_page = ListPage(self).add_list_item('Get help')

        # She notices a "Share this list" option
        share_box = list_page.get_share_box()
        self.assertEqual(
            share_box.get_attribute('placeholder'),
            'your-friend@example.com'
        )

        # She shares her list.
        # The page updates to say that it's shared with Oniciferous:
        list_page.share_list_with('oniciferous@example.com')
----
====

//TODO: all these skipmes could be tested by doing a checkout of the page_pattern branch

And the +Page+ class looks like this:

[role="sourcecode small-code skipme"]
.functional_tests/lists_pages.py
====
[source,python]
----
class ListPage(object):

    def __init__(self, test):
        self.test = test


    def get_table_rows(self):
        return self.test.browser.find_elements_by_css_selector('#id_list_table tr')


    @wait
    def wait_for_row_in_list_table(self, item_text, item_number):
        row_text = '{}: {}'.format(item_number, item_text)
        rows = self.get_table_rows()
        self.test.assertIn(row_text, [row.text for row in rows])


    def get_item_input_box(self):
        return self.test.browser.find_element(By.ID, 'id_text')
----
====

So it's definitely possible to implement a similar layer of abstraction,
and a sort of DSL, in inline-style FTs, whether it's by using the Page
pattern or whatever structure you prefer--but now it's a matter of
self-discipline, rather than having a framework that pushes you towards
it.

NOTE: In fact, you can actually use the Page pattern with BDD as well, as
    a resource for your steps to use when navigating the pages of your site.


=== BDD Might Be Less Expressive than Inline Comments

((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", "vs. inline comments", secondary-sortas="inline comments")))
((("inline comments")))
On the other hand, I can also see potential for the Gherkin syntax to
feel somewhat restrictive.  Compare how expressive and readable the
inline-style comments are, with the slightly awkward BDD feature:


[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.functional_tests/test_my_lists.py
====
[source,python]
----
    # Edith is a logged-in user
    # She goes to the home page and starts a list
    # She notices a "My lists" link, for the first time.

That's much more readable and natural than our slightly forced Given/Then/When
incantations, and, in a way, might encourage more user-centric thinking. (There
is a syntax in Gherkin for including "comments" in a feature file, which would
mitigate this somewhat, but I gather that it's not widely used.)


=== Will Nonprogrammers Write Tests?

((("behavior-driven development (BDD)", "benefits and drawbacks of")))I
haven't touched on one of the original promises of BDD, which is that
nonprogrammers--business or client representatives perhaps--might actually
write the Gherkin syntax.  I'm quite skeptical about whether this would
actually work in the real world, but I don't think that detracts from the other
potential benefits of BDD.


=== Some Tentative Conclusions

I've only dipped my toes into the BDD world, so I'm hesitant to draw any firm
conclusions. I find the "forced" structuring of FTs into steps very appealing
though--in that it looks like it has the potential to encourage a lot of reuse in your
FT code, and that it neatly separates concerns between describing the story
and implementing it, and that it forces us to think about things in terms of
the business domain, rather than in terms of "what we need to do with
Selenium."

But there's no free lunch. The Gherkin syntax is restrictive, compared to
the total freedom offered by inline FT comments.

I also would like to see how BDD scales once you have not just one or two
features, and four or five steps, but several dozen features and hundreds of
lines of steps code.

Overall, I would say it's definitely worth investigating, and I will probably
use BDD for my next personal project.

My thanks to Daniel Pope, Rachel Willmer, and Jared Contrascere for their
feedback on this chapter.


.BDD Conclusions
*******************************************************************************

Encourages structured, reusable test code::
    By separating concerns, breaking your FTs out into the human-readable,
    Gherkin syntax "feature" file and a separate implementation of steps
    functions, BDD has the potential to encourage more reusable and manageable
    test code.

It may come at the expense of readability::
    The Gherkin syntax, for all its attempt to be human-readable, is ultimately
    a constraint on human language, and so it may not capture nuance and
    intention as well as inline comments do.

Try it! I will::
    As I keep saying, I haven't used BDD on a real project, so you should take
    my words with a heavy pinch of salt, but I'd like to give it a hearty
    endorsement.  I'm going to try it out on the next project I can, and I'd
    encourage you to do so as well.((("", startref="bdd31")))
