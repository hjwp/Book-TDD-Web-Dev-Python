== What Are We Doing with All These Tests? (And, Refactoring)

((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "need for", id="TDDneed04")))
Now that we've seen the basics of TDD in action,
it's time to pause and talk about why we're doing it.

I'm imagining several of you, dear readers, have been holding back
some seething frustration--perhaps some of you have done a bit of unit testing before,
and perhaps some of you are just in a hurry.
You've been biting back questions like:

* Aren't all these tests a bit excessive?

* Surely some of them are redundant?
  There's duplication between the functional tests and the unit tests.

* Those unit tests seemed way too trivial--testing
  a one-line function that returns a constant!
  Isn't that just a waste of time?
  Shouldn't we save our tests for more complex things?

* What about all those tiny changes during the unit-test/code cycle?
  Couldn't we just skip to the end? I mean, `home_page = None`!?  Really?

* You're not telling me you _actually_ code like this in real life?

Ah, young grasshopper. I too was once full of questions like these.
But only because they're perfectly good questions.
In fact, I still ask myself questions like these—all the time.
Does all this stuff really have value? Is this a bit of a cargo cult?



=== Programming Is Like Pulling a Bucket of Water [keep-together]#Up from a Well#

((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "philosophy of", "bucket of water analogy")))
Ultimately, programming is hard.  Often, we are smart, so we succeed.
TDD is there to help us out when we're not so smart.
Kent Beck (who basically invented TDD) uses the metaphor
of lifting a bucket of water out of a well with a rope:
when the well isn't too deep, and the bucket isn't very full, it's easy.
And even lifting a full bucket is pretty easy at first.
But after a while, you're going to get tired.
TDD is like having a ratchet that lets you save your progress,
so you can take a break, and make sure you never slip backwards.

That way, you don't have to be smart _all_ the time (see <<figure4-1>>).

.Test ALL the things (adapted from https://oreil.ly/n_8R_[Allie Brosh, Hyperbole and a Half])
image::images/tdd3_0401.png["Test ALL the things",float="right"]


OK, perhaps _in general_, you're prepared to concede that TDD is a good
idea, but maybe you still think I'm overdoing it?  Testing the tiniest thing,
and taking ridiculously many small steps?

TDD is a _discipline_, and that means it's not something that comes naturally.
Because many of the payoffs aren't immediate but only come in the longer term,
you have to force yourself to do it in the moment.
That's what the image of the Testing Goat is supposed to represent--you
need to be a bit bloody-minded about it.

[[trivial_tests_trivial_functions]]
.On the Merits of Trivial Tests for Trivial Functions
**********************************************************************
In the short term, it may feel a bit silly to write tests for simple
functions and [keep-together]#constants#.

It's perfectly possible to imagine still doing ``mostly'' TDD,
but following more relaxed rules where you don't unit test _absolutely_ everything.
But in this book my aim is to demonstrate full, rigorous TDD.
Like a kata in a martial art,
the idea is to learn the motions in a controlled context,
when there is no adversity,
so that the techniques are part of your muscle memory.
It seems trivial now, because we've started with a very simple example.
The problem comes when your application gets complex--that's when you really need your tests.
And the danger is that complexity tends to sneak up on you, gradually.
You may not notice it happening, but soon you're a boiled frog.

There are two other things to say in favour of tiny, simple tests for simple functions.

Firstly, if they're really trivial tests,
then they won't take you that long to write.
So stop moaning and just write them already.

Secondly, it's always good to have a placeholder.
Having a test _there_ for a simple function
means it's that much less of a psychological barrier to overcome
when the simple function gets a tiny bit more complex--perhaps
it grows an `if`.
Then a few weeks later, it grows a `for` loop.
Before you know it, it's a recursive metaclass-based polymorphic tree parser factory.
But because it's had tests from the very beginning,
adding a new test each time has felt quite natural,
and it's well tested.
The alternative involves trying to decide when a function becomes ``complicated enough'',
which is highly subjective.
And worse, because there's no placeholder,
it feels like that much more effort to start,
so you're tempted each time to put it off...and pretty soon--frog soup!

Instead of trying to figure out some hand-wavy subjective rules
for when you should write tests,
and when you can get away with not bothering,
I suggest following the discipline for now--and as with any discipline,
you have to take the time to learn the rules before you can break them.

Now, let us return to our muttons.

=== Using Selenium to Test User Interactions

((("Selenium", "testing user interactions with", id="Suser04")))
((("user interactions", "testing with Selenium", id="UIselenium04")))
Where were we at the end of the last chapter?
Let's rerun the test and find out:

Did you try it, and get an error saying "Problem loading page" or
"Unable to connect"?  So did I. It's because we forgot to spin up the dev
server first using `manage.py runserver`.  Do that, and you'll get the failure
message we're after.

NOTE: One of the great things about TDD is that you never have to worry
    about forgetting what to do next--just rerun your tests
    and they will tell you what you need to work on.

//IDEA: stop using id_new_item, just use name=

[role="pagebreak-before"]
<1> We're using the two methods that Selenium provides to examine web pages:
    `find_element` and `find_elements`
    (notice the extra `s`,
    which means it will return several elements rather than just one).
    Each one is parameterised with a `By.SOMETHING`,
    which lets us search using different HTML properties and attributes.

<2> We also use `send_keys`,
    which is Selenium's way of typing into input elements.

<3> The `Keys` class (don't forget to import it)
    lets us send special keys like Enter.footnote:[
    You could also just use the string +"\n"+, but `Keys`
    also lets you send special keys like Ctrl, so I thought I'd show it.]

<4> When we hit Enter, the page will refresh.
    The `time.sleep` is there to make sure the browser has finished loading
    before we make any assertions about the new page.((("explicit and implicit waits")))
    This is called an "explicit wait"
    (a very simple one; we'll improve it in <<chapter_06_explicit_waits_1>>).

TIP: Watch out for the difference between the Selenium `find_element()`
    and `find_elements()` functions.
    One returns an element and raises an exception if it can't find it,
    whereas the other returns a list, which may be empty.


Also, just look at that `any()` function.
It's a little-known Python built-in.
I don't even need to explain it, do I?
Python is such a joy.footnote:[
Python _is_ most definitely a joy,
but if you think I'm being a bit smug here,
I don't blame you!
Actually, I wish I'd picked up on this feeling of self-satisfaction
and seen it as a warning sign that I was being a little _too_ clever.
In the next chapter, you'll see I get my comeuppance.]


NOTE: If you're one of my readers who doesn't know Python,
    what's happening _inside_ the `any()` may need some explaining.
    The basic syntax is that of a _list comprehension_,
    and if you haven't learned about them, you should do so immediately!
    https://oreil.ly/6bX0h[Trey Hunner's explanation is excellent].
    In point of fact, because we're omitting the square brackets,
    we're actually using a _generator expression_ rather than a list comprehension.
    It's probably less important to understand the difference between those two,
    but if you're curious, Guido van Rossum, the inventor of Python, has written https://oreil.ly/Om6vK[a blog post explaining the difference].((("generator expressions")))((("list comprehensions")))

=== The "Don't Test Constants" Rule, and Templates to the Rescue


((("“Don’t Test Constants” rule", primary-sortas="Don’t Test Constants rule")))
((("unit tests", "“Don’t Test Constants” rule", secondary-sortas="Don’t Test Constants rule")))((("constants", "“Don’t Test Constants” rule", secondary-sortas="Don&#x27;t")))
Let's take a look at our unit tests, _lists/tests.py_.
Currently we're looking for specific HTML strings,
but that's not a particularly efficient way of testing HTML.
In general, one of the rules of unit testing is "don't test constants",
and testing HTML as text is a lot like testing a constant.

In other words, if you have some code that says:


[role="skipme"]
[source,python]
----
wibble = 3
----

There's not much point in a test that says:

[role="skipme"]
[source,python]
----
from myprogram import wibble
assert wibble == 3
----

Unit tests are really about testing logic, flow control, and configuration.
Making assertions about exactly what sequence of characters we have in our HTML strings isn't doing that.

It's not _quite_ that simple, because HTML is code after all,
and we do want something to check that we've written code that works—but that's our FT's job, not the unit test's.

So maybe "don't test constants" isn't the online guideline at play here,
but in any case, mangling raw strings in Python
really isn't a great way of dealing with HTML.
There's a much better solution, which is to use templates.
Quite apart from anything else,
if we can keep HTML to one side in a file whose name ends in '.html',
we'll get better syntax highlighting!

There are lots of Python templating frameworks out there,
and Django has its own which works very well.
Let's use that.


==== Refactoring to Use a Template

((("unit tests", "refactoring in", id="UTrefactor04")))
((("refactoring", id="refactor04")))((("templates", "refactoring unit tests to use", id="ix_tmplref")))
What we want to do now is make our view function return exactly the same HTML,
but just using a different process.
That's a refactor--when we try to improve the code
_without changing its functionality_.

That last bit is really important.
If you try to add new functionality at the same time as refactoring,
you're much more likely to run into trouble.
Refactoring is actually a whole discipline in itself,
and it even has a reference book:
Martin Fowler's http://refactoring.com[_Refactoring_].

The first rule is that you can't refactor without tests.
Thankfully, we're doing TDD, so we're way ahead of the game.
Let's check that our tests pass;
they will be what makes sure that our refactoring is behaviour-preserving:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py test*
[...]
OK
----

Great! We'll start by taking our HTML string and putting it into its own file.
Create a directory called _lists/templates_ to keep templates in,
and then open a file at _lists/templates/home.html_,
to which we'll transfer our HTML:footnote:[
Some people like to use another subfolder named after the app
(i.e., _lists/templates/lists_) and then refer to the template as _lists/home.html_.
This is called "template namespacing".
I figured it was overcomplicated for this small project, but it may be worth it on larger projects.
There's more in the
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/tutorial03/#write-views-that-actually-do-something[Django tutorial].]

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html (ch04l002)
====
[source,html]
----
<html>
  <title>To-Do lists</title>
</html>
----
====


Mmm, syntax-highlighted...much nicer! Now to change our view function:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch04l003)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.shortcuts import render


def home_page(request):
    return render(request, "home.html")
----
====

Instead of building our own `HttpResponse`, we now use the Django `render()`
function.  It takes the request as its first parameter (for reasons we'll go
into later) and the name of the template to render.  Django will automatically
search folders called _templates_ inside any of your apps' directories.  Then
it builds an `HttpResponse` for you, based on the content of the template.


NOTE: Templates are a very powerful feature of Django's,
    and their main strength consists of substituting Python variables into HTML text.
    We're not using this feature yet, but we will in future chapters.
    That's why we use `render()` rather than, say,
    manually reading the file from disk with the built-in `open()`.


Let's see if it works:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros,callouts"]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.074s
----

Another chance to analyse a traceback:

<1> We start with the error: it can't find the template.

<2> Then we double-check what test is failing: sure enough, it's our test
    of the view HTML.

<3> Then we find the line in our tests that caused the failure: it's when
    we request the root URL ("/").

<4> Finally, we look for the part of our own application code that caused the
    failure: it's when we try to call `render`.

So why can't Django find the template?
It's right where it's supposed to be, in the _lists/templates_ folder.

The thing is that we haven't yet _officially_ registered our lists app with Django.
Unfortunately, just running the `startapp` command
and having what is obviously an app in your project folder
isn't quite enough.
You have to tell Django that you _really_ mean it,
and add it to 'settings.py' as well—belt and braces.
Open it up and look for a variable called `INSTALLED_APPS`,
to which we'll add `lists`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/settings.py (ch04l004)
====
[source,python]
----
# Application definition

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "lists",
]
----
====

You can see there's lots of apps already in there by default.
We just need to add ours to the bottom of the list.
Don't forget the trailing comma--it may not be required,
but one day you'll be really annoyed when you forget it
and Python concatenates two strings on different lines...

Now we can try running the tests again:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py test*
[...]
OK
----

And we can double-check with the FTs:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python functional_tests.py*
[...]
  File "...goat-book/functional_tests.py", line 22, in
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: h1; For documentation on this error, please visit: [...]
----


Good, they still get to the same place they did before.
Our refactor of the code is now complete,
and the tests mean we're happy that behaviour is preserved.
Now we can change the tests so that they're no longer testing constants;
instead, they should just check that we're rendering the right template.((("templates", "refactoring unit tests to use", startref="ix_tmplref")))
((("", startref="refactor04")))
((("", startref="UTrefactor04")))



=== Revisiting Our Unit Tests

Our unit tests are currently essentially checking HTML by hand—certainly that's very close to "testing constants".

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.lists/tests.py
====
[source,python]
----
def test_home_page_returns_correct_html(self):
    response = self.client.get("/")
    self.assertContains(response, "<title>To-Do lists</title>")  # <1>
    self.assertContains(response, "<html>")
    self.assertContains(response, "</html>")
----
====

We don't want to be duplicating the full content of our HTML
template in our tests, or even last sections of it.
What could we do instead?

Rather than testing the full template,
we could just check that we're using the _right_ template.
The Django test client has a method, `assertTemplateUsed`,
which will let us do just that.((("templates", "checking that right template is used")))


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch04l005)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_home_page_returns_correct_html(self):
    response = self.client.get("/")
    self.assertContains(response, "<title>To-Do lists</title>")  # <1>
    self.assertContains(response, "<html>")
    self.assertContains(response, "</html>")
    self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "home.html")  # <2>
----
====

<1> We'll leave the old tests there for now,
    just to make sure everything is working the way we think it is.

<2> `.assertTemplateUsed` lets us check what template was used to render a response.
    (NB: It will only work for responses that were retrieved by the test client.)

And that test will still pass:

----
Ran 1 tests in 0.016s

OK
----

Just because I'm always suspicious of a test I haven't seen fail, let's
deliberately break it:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch04l006)
====
[source,python]
----
self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "wrong.html")
----
====

[role="pagebreak-before"]
That way, we'll also learn what its error messages look like:

----
AssertionError: False is not true : Template 'wrong.html' was not a template
used to render the response. Actual template(s) used: home.html
----

That's very helpful!

Let's change the assert back to the right thing.


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch04l007)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.test import TestCase


class HomePageTest(TestCase):
    def test_uses_home_template(self):
        response = self.client.get("/")
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "home.html")
----
====


Now, instead of testing constants we're testing at a higher level of abstraction.
Great!


==== Test Behaviour, Not Implementation

As so often in the world of programming though,
things are not black and white.((("behaviour", "testing behaviour, not implementation")))

Yes, on the plus side, our tests no longer care about the specific content of our HTML
so they are no longer brittle with respect to minor changes of the copy in our template.

But on the other hand, they depend on some Django implementation details,
so they _are_ brittle with respect to changing the template rendering library,
or even just renaming templates.

In a way, testing for the template name
(and implicitly, even checking that we used a template at all)
is a lot like testing implementation.
So what is the _behaviour_ that we want?

Yes, in a sense, the "behaviour" we want from the view is "render the template".
But from the point of view of the user,
it's "show me the home page".

We're also vulnerable to accidentally breaking the template.
Let's try it now,
by just deleting all the contents of the template file:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *mv lists/templates/home.html lists/templates/home.html.bak*
$ *touch lists/templates/home.html*
$ *python manage.py test*
[...]
OK
----

[role="pagebreak-before"]
Yes, our FTs will pick up on this, so ultimately we're OK:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python functional_tests.py*]
[...]
    self.assertIn("To-Do", self.browser.title)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError: 'To-Do' not found in ''
----

But it would be nice to have our unit tests pick up on this too:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *mv lists/templates/home.html.bak lists/templates/home.html*
----


Deciding exactly what to test with FTs and what to test with unit tests
is a fine line, and the objective is not to double-test everything.
But in general, the more we can test with unit tests the better.
They run faster, and they give more specific feedback.((("smoke tests")))

So, let's bring back a minimal "smoke test"footnote:[
A smoke test is a minimal test that can quickly tell you if something is wrong,
without exhaustively testing every aspect that you might care about.
Wikipedia has some fun speculation on the
https://oreil.ly/1_isl[etymology].]
to check that what we're rendering is actually the home page:



[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch04l008)
====
[source,python]
----
class HomePageTest(TestCase):
    def test_uses_home_template(self):
        response = self.client.get("/")
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "home.html")  # <1>

    def test_renders_homepage_content(self):
        response = self.client.get("/")
        self.assertContains(response, "To-Do")  # <2>
----
====

<1> We'll keep this first test, which asserts on whether we're rendering the
    right "constant".

<2> And this gives us a minimal smoke test that we have got the right
    content in the template.

[role="pagebreak-before"]
As our home page template gains more functionality over the next couple of chapters,
we'll come back to talking about what to test here in the unit tests
and what to leave to the FTs.

TIP: Unit tests give you faster and more specific feedback than FTs.
  Bear this in mind when deciding what to test where.


We'll visit the trade-offs between different types of tests
at several points in the book, and particularly in <<chapter_27_hot_lava>>.


=== On Refactoring

((("unit tests", "refactoring in")))
((("refactoring")))
That was an absolutely trivial example of refactoring.
But, as Kent Beck puts it in _Test-Driven Development: By Example_,
"Am I recommending that you actually work this way? No.
I'm recommending that you be _able_ to work this way".

In fact, as I was writing this my first instinct was to dive in
and change the test first--make it
use the `assertTemplateUsed()` function straight away;
against the expected render;
and then go ahead and make the code change.
But notice how that actually would have left space
for me to break things:
I could have defined the template as containing 'any' arbitrary string,
instead of the string with the right `<html>` and `<title>` tags.

TIP: When refactoring, work on either the code or the tests,
    but not both at once.

// SEBASTIAN: I'd put in other words, perhaps as an additional paragraph.
//     Change one thing at a time - either code or the tests.
//     After introducing changes to one of them, run the tests.
//     If they pass, carry on with changing the other. If they don't - fix the tests first.
//     *It's virtually impossible (also for experienced software developer) to precisely*
//     *pinpoint source of error if you ended up with failing tests after changing both*
//     *the tests and code.*

There's always a tendency to skip ahead a couple of steps,
to make a few tweaks to the behaviour while you're refactoring.
But pretty soon you've got changes to half a dozen different files,
you've totally lost track of where you are, and nothing works anymore.
If you don't want to end up like https://oreil.ly/F_Hqf[Refactoring Cat] (<<RefactoringCat>>),
stick to small steps; keep refactoring and functionality changes entirely separate.

NOTE: We'll come across Refactoring Cat again during this book,
    as an example of what happens when we get carried away
    and change too many things at once.
    Think of it as the little cartoon demon counterpart to the Testing Goat,
    popping up over your other shoulder and giving you bad advice.

It's a good idea to do a commit after any refactoring:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status* # see tests.py, views.py, settings.py, + new templates folder
$ *git add .*  # will also add the untracked templates folder
$ *git diff --staged* # review the changes we're about to commit
$ *git commit -m "Refactor homepage view to use a template"*

=== A Little More of Our Front Page

In the meantime, our FT is still failing.((("functional  tests (FTs)", "passing test on home page")))
Let's now make an actual code change to get it passing.
Because our HTML is now in a template,
we can feel free to make changes to it,
without needing to write any extra unit tests.

NOTE: This is another distinction between FTs and unit tests;
    because the FTs use a real web browser,
    we use them as the primary tool for testing our UI,
    and the HTML that implements it.

So, we wanted an `<h1>`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html (ch04l009)
====
[source,html]
----
<html>
  <head>
    <title>To-Do lists</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Your To-Do list</h1>
  </body>
</html>
----
====

Let's see if our FT likes it a little better:

----
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: [id="id_new_item"]; For documentation on this error, [...]
----

OK, let's add an input with that ID:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html (ch04l010)
====
[source,html]
----
  [...]
  <body>
    <h1>Your To-Do list</h1>
    <input id="id_new_item" />
  </body>
</html>
----
====

And now what does the FT say?

----
AssertionError: '' != 'Enter a to-do item'
----

We add our placeholder text...

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html (ch04l011)
====
[source,html]
----
    <input id="id_new_item" placeholder="Enter a to-do item" />
----
====

Which gives:

----
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: [id="id_list_table"]; [...]
----

So we can go ahead and put the table onto the page. At this stage it'll just be empty:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html (ch04l012)
====
[source,html]
----
    <input id="id_new_item" placeholder="Enter a to-do item" />
    <table id="id_list_table">
    </table>
  </body>
----
====

What does the FT think?

----
[...]
  File "...goat-book/functional_tests.py", line 40, in
test_can_start_a_todo_list
    self.assertTrue(any(row.text == "1: Buy peacock feathers" for row in rows))
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError: False is not true
----



Slightly cryptic!
We can use the line number to track it down,
and it turns out it's that `any()` function I was so smug about earlier--or,
more precisely, the `assertTrue`, which doesn't have a very explicit failure message.((("error messages", "passing custom error message to assertX methods in unittest")))((("unittest module", "passing custom error message to assertX methods in")))
We can pass a custom error message as an argument to most `assertX` methods in `unittest`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests.py (ch04l013)
====
[source,python]
----
    self.assertTrue(
        any(row.text == "1: Buy peacock feathers" for row in rows),
        "New to-do item did not appear in table",
    )
----
====

If you run the FT again, you should see our helpful message:

----
AssertionError: False is not true : New to-do item did not appear in table
----


But now, to get this to pass, we will need to actually process the user's form submission.
And that's a topic for the next chapter.

For now let's do a commit:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff*
$ *git commit -am "Front page HTML now generated from a template"*
----


Thanks to a bit of refactoring,
we've got our view set up to render a template,
we've stopped testing constants,
and we're now well placed to start processing user input.


=== Recap: The TDD Process


((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "concepts", "Red/Green/Refactor")))
((("Red/Green/Refactor")))
((("unit-test/code cycle")))
((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "overall process of", id="TDDprocess04")))
We've now seen all the main aspects of the TDD process, in practice:

* Functional tests
* Unit tests
* The unit-test/code cycle
* Refactoring

It's time for a little recap, and perhaps even some flowcharts.
(Forgive me, my years misspent as a management consultant have ruined me.
On the plus side, said flowcharts will feature recursion!)

What does the overall TDD process look like?

* We write a test.
* We run the test and see it fail.
* We write some minimal code to get it a little further.
* We rerun the test and repeat until it passes (the unit-test/code cycle)
* Then, we look for opportunities to refactor our code,
  using our tests to make sure we don't break anything.
* Then, we look for opportunities to refactor our tests too,
  while attempting to stick to rules like
  "test behaviour, not implementation" and "don't test constants".
* And start again from the top!

See <<simple-tdd-diagram>>.

.TDD process as a flowchart, including the unit-test/code cycle
image::images/tdd3_0403.png["A flowchart with boxes for tests, coding and refactoring, with yes/no labels showing when we move forwards or backwards"]

It's very common to talk about this process using the three words:
_red/green/refactor_. See <<red-green-refactor>>.

[[red-green-refactor]]
.Red/green/refactor
image::images/tdd3_0404.png["Red, green, and refactor as three nodes in a circle, with arrows flowing around."]

* We write a test, and see it fail ("red").
* We cycle between code and tests until the test passes ("green").
* Then, we look for opportunities to refactor.
* Repeat as required!

==== Double-loop TDD

But how does this apply when we have functional tests _and_ unit tests?
Well, you can think of the FT as driving a higher-level version of the same((("double-loop TDD")))((("Red/Green/Refactor", "inner and outer loops in"))) cycle,
with an inner red/green/refactor loop being required to get an FT from red to green; see <<double-loop-tdd-diagram>>.

[[double-loop-tdd-diagram]]
.Double-loop TDD: Inner and outer loops
image::images/tdd3_0702.png["An inner red/green/refactor loop surrounded by an outer red/green of FTs"]

When a new feature or business requirement comes along,
we write a new (failing) FT to capture a high-level view of the requirement.
It may not cover every last edge case,
but it should be enough to reassure ourselves that things are working.

To get that FT to green,
we then enter into the lower-level unit test cycle,
where we put together all the moving parts required,
and add tests for all the edge cases.
Any time we get to green and refactored at the unit test level,
we can pop back up to the FT level to guide us towards the
next thing we need to work on.
Once both levels are green, we can do any extra refactoring
or work on edge cases.

// SEBASTIAN: It's a great moment to stop and reflect on the things a reader learnt so far.
//    From my POV, introducing diagrams and explaining them encourages reader to
//    generalise knowledge they acquired so far.
//    Therefore, it would be great to recap on how these cycles were in play in this
//    and previous chapters.
//    TL;DR: more diagrams pls.

We'll explore all of the different parts of this workflow in more detail
over the coming chapters.

.How to "Check" Your Code, or Skip Ahead (If You Must)
*******************************************************************************

((("GitHub")))
((("code examples, obtaining and using")))
All of the code examples I've used in the book are available
in https://github.com/hjwp/book-example/[my repo on GitHub].
So, if you ever want to compare your code against mine,
you can take a look at it there.

Each chapter has its own branch, which is named after its short name.
The https://github.com/hjwp/book-example/tree/chapter_04_philosophy_and_refactoring[one for this chapter] is a snapshot of the code as it should be at the _end_ of the chapter.

You can find a full list of them in <<appendix_github_links>>, as well as
instructions on how to download them or use Git to compare your code to
mine.

Obviously I can't possibly condone it,
but you can also use my repo to "skip ahead"
and check out the code to let you work on a later chapter
without having worked through all the earlier chapters yourself.
You're only cheating yourself you know!
