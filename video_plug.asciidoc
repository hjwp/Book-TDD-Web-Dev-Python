((("companion video")))((("video-based instruction")))((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "video-based instruction")))
I've recorded a 
https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/test-driven-development/9781491919163[10-part video series
to accompany this book].footnote:[The video has not been updated for the third edition,
but the content is all mostly the same.]
It covers the content of <<part1>>.
If you find you learn well from video-based material, then I encourage you to check it out.
Over and above what's in the book,
it should give you a feel for what the "flow" of TDD is like,
flicking between tests and code, explaining the thought process as we go.

Plus I'm wearing a delightful yellow T-shirt.
