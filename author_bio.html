  <h1>About the Author</h1>
  <p>After an idyllic childhood spent playing with BASIC on French 8-bit computers like the Thomson T07 whose keys go "boop" when you press them, <strong>Harry Percival</strong> spent a few years being deeply unhappy with economics and management consultancy. Soon, he rediscovered his true geek nature, and was lucky enough to fall in with a bunch of XP fanatics, working on the pioneering but sadly defunct Resolver One spreadsheet. He now works at PythonAnywhere LLP, and spreads the gospel of test-driven development worldwide at talks, workshops, and conferences, with all the passion and enthusiasm of a recent convert.</p>
