# Today


## to consider

- remove virtualenvs from diagram
- dev-requirements.txt
- assertEqual(items.objects.all, []) in chap 4 and plus.
    nice explanation of the importance of helplful error messages
* shellscripts for all infra stuff
- rewrite all test names in js chapter



# Later

* was lxml overkill?  can just use `assertContains(name=text)`
  or `assertContains(action=/foo/bla)
* add a new chapter 8 where we delete the multiple users FT??? ðŸ˜±
* item_set -> use related_name.
* change URLs to be more restey
* TEST_HOST
* appendix on tradeoffs and testing
* remove isinstance(form) from 15+?

* run thru using docker+ansible on windows via wsl2.  needs non-macos host machine,
    bc docker desktop needs hyper-v, and that needs nested virtualisation,
    and that's not supported by parallels or virtualbox, on apple silicon

* hash the tokens
* investigate this flakiness in 15 https://github.com/hjwp/Book-TDD-Web-Dev-Python/actions/runs/13393304093/job/37405965975

* switch to more rest-ful url structure in 7
- consider splitting 23 into two chapters
- figure out how to delete at least one FT?
- spike chap:  start with test of login view.
- pytest
- "switch to flask" appendix
- pytest appendix
- run thru and test WSL

## switch to postgres?

- do it in deploy chaps
- production-readiness really
- install it locally?
- or, put it in a docker container?
- docker-compose??

# Appendix ideas

- new appendix on js modules
- appendix where we get rid of model-layer tests?



# OLD TODOS
get rid of staging/live.


mention pdb.set_trace()

add a note re double-checking the django version with django-admin.py --version

build some tests for all the URLs, add to jenkins


# DONE
- count all TR notes per chapter
- python 3.13
- massive updates in 11
- update chap 21 server debugging, do with docker instead?
- requirements.txt chat into 10
* remove all 'fab' handling from tests eg in sourcetree.py
* mention https://testdesiderata.com/ somewhere
