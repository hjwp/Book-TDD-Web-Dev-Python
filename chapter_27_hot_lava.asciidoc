== Fast Tests, Slow Tests, and Hot Lava

[quote, 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsmFVb8guMU[Casey Kinsey]']
______________________________________________________________
The database is Hot Lava!
______________________________________________________________

We've come to the end of the book,
and the end of our journey with this To-Do app and its tests.
Let's recap our test structure so far:

* We have a suite of "functional tests" that use Selenium to test that the whole app really works.
  On several occations, the FTs have saved us from shipping broken code,
  whether it was broken CSS, a broken database due to filesystem permissions, or broken email integration.

* And we have a suit of "unit tests" that use Django's test client,
  that enable us to test-drive our code for models, forms, views, urls, and even, to some extent, templates.
  They've enabled us to build the app incrementally, to refactor with confidence,
  and they've supported a fast unit-test/code cycle.

We've also spent a good bit of time on our infrastructure,
packaging up our app with Docker for ease of deployment,
and we've set up a CI pipeline to run our tests automatically on push.

Being a simple app that could fit in a book though,
there are inevitably some limitations and simplifications in our approach.
In this chapter I'd like to talk about how to carry your testing principles forward,
as you move into larger, more complex applications in the real world.

Let's find out why someone might say that the database is hot lava!


=== Why Do We Test? Our Desiderata for Effective Tests

At https://testdesiderata.com/[testdesiderata.com], Kent Beck and Kelly Sutton
outline several desiderata (desirable characteristics) for tests:

.Test Desiderata
|===
| Isolated--tests should return the same results regardless of the order in which they are run.
| Composable--I should be able to test different dimensions of variability separately and combine the results.
| Deterministic--if nothing changes, the test result shouldn’t change.
| Fast--tests should run quickly.
| Writable--tests should be cheap to write relative to the cost of the code being tested.
| Readable--tests should be comprehensible for reader, invoking the motivation for writing this particular test.
| Behavioural--tests should be sensitive to changes in the behaviour of the code under test. If the behaviour changes, the test result should change.
| Structure-agnostic--tests should not change their result if the structure of the code changes.
| Automated--tests should run without human intervention.
| Specific--if a test fails, the cause of the failure should be obvious.
| Predictive--if the tests all pass, then the code under test should be suitable for production.
| Inspiring--passing the tests should inspire confidence
|===

We've talked about almost all of these desiderata in the book:
we talked about _isolation_ when we switched to using the Django test runner.
We talked about _composability_ when discussing the car factory example in <<chapter_21_mocking_2>>.
We talked about tests being _readable_ when we talked about the Given/When/Then structure,
and when implementing helper methods in our FTs.
We talked about testing _behaviour_ rather than implementation at several points,
including in the mocking chapters.
We talked about _structure_ in the forms chapters,
when we showed that the higher-level views tests enabled us to refactor more freely than the lower-level forms tests.
We've talked about splitting up our tests to have fewer assertions to make them more _specific_.
We talked about _determinism_ when discussing flaky tests and the use of `wait_for()` in our FTs, for example, as well as in the production debugging chapter.

In this chapter, we're going to talk primarily about speed, and about what makes tests inspiring.

But it's worth taking a step back from the list above, and saying:
"what do we want from our tests?"


==== Confidence & Correctness (Preventing Regression)

A fundamental part of programming is that now and again
you need to check whether "it works".
Automated testing is the solution to the fact that checking things manually
quickly gets tedious, and unreliable.
We want our tests to tell us that our code works,
both at the low level of individual functions or classes,
and at the higher level of "does it all hang together?".

==== A Productive Workflow

Our tests need to be fast enough to write,
but more importantly, fast to run.
We want to get into a smooth, productive workflow,
and try to enter into that holy credo of programmers, the "flow state".
Beyond that, we want our tests to take some of the stress out of programming,
encouraging us to work in small increments,
with frequent bursts of dopamine from seeing green tests.

==== Driving Better Design

Finally our tests should help us to write better code.
Firstly, by enabling fearless refactoring.
Secondly, by giving us feedback on the design of our code.
Writing the tests first lets us think about our API from the outside-in,
before we write it--and we've seen that.
But in this chapter we'll also talk about the potential for
tests to give you feedback on our design in more subtle ways.
As we'll see, designing code to be more testable
often leads to code that has clearly identified dependencies,
and is more modular and more decoupled.



As we continuously think about what kinds of tests to write
we are trying to achieve the optimum balance of these different desiderata.



=== Were Our Unit Tests Integration Tests All Along? What is That Warm Glow Coming from the Database?

((("integration tests", "vs. unit tests", secondary-sortas="unit tests")))
((("unit tests", "vs. integration tests", secondary-sortas="integration tests")))
Almost all of the "unit" tests in the book
should perhaps have been called _integration_ tests,
because they all rely on Django's test runner,
which gives us a real database to talk to.
Many also use the Django Test Client,
which does a lot of magic with the middleware layers that sit between requests.
The end result is that our tests are heavily integrated with both the database,
and Django itself.


==== We've Been in the "Sweet Spot"

Now, actually, this has been a pretty good thing for us so far.
We're very much in the "sweet spot" of Django's testing tools,
and our unit tests have been fast enough to enable a smooth workflow,
and they've given us a lot that our application really works,
from the models all the way up to the templates.
By allying them with a small-ish suite of functional tests,
we've got a lot of confidence in our code.
And we've been able to use them to get at least a bit of feedback on our design,
and to enable lots of refactoring.


==== What is a "True" Unit Test?  Does it Matter?

But people will often tell you that a "true" unit test should be more isolated.
It's meant to test a single "unit" of software,
and your database "should" be outside of that.
Why do they say that?
Apart from the lovely warm glow of smug that they get from should-ing us?

As you can tell,
I think the argument from definitions is a bit of a red herring.
But you might hear instead, "the database is hot lava!"
as Casey Kinsey put it in a memorable DjangoCon talk.
There is real feeling and real experience behind these comments.
What are people getting at?


==== Integration and Functional Tests Get Slower Over Time

The problem is that, as your application and your codebase grows,
involving the database in every single test starts to carry an unacceptable cost,
in terms of the speed of execution of nothing else;
Casey's company was struggling with test suites that took several hours.

At PythonAnywhere, our functional test suite didn't just rely on the database,
it would spin up a full test cluster of 6 virtual machines.
A full run used to take at least 12 hours,
and we'd have to wait overnight for our results.

At Kraken, the full test suite does only take about 45 minutes,
but that's only thanks to a quite frankly ridiculous level of parallelisation
and associated expenditure on CI.
We're now spending a lot of effort on trying to move more of our unit
tests to being "true" unit tests.

The problem is that these things don't scale linearly.
The more database tables you have,
the more foreign keys between them,
and the relationships can start to increase geometrically.

So you can see why, over time, these kinds of tests
are going to fail to meet our desiderata because they're too slow
to enable a productive workflow and a fast enough feedback cycle.


NOTE: Don't take it from me!
  Gary Bernhardt, a legend in both the Ruby and Python testing world,
  has a talk simply called
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAxiiRPHS9k[Fast Test, Slow Test],
  which is a great tour of the problems I'm discussing here.


.The Holy Flow State
*******************************************************************************
Thinking sociology for a moment, we programmers have our own culture,
and our own tribal religion in a way.
It has many congregations within it
such as the cult of TDD to which you are now initiated.
There are the followers of vim and the heretics of emacs.
But one thing we all agree on, one particular spiritual practice,
our own transcendental meditation, is the holy flow state.
That feeling of pure focus, of concentration,
where hours pass like no time at all,
where code flows naturally from our fingers,
where problems are just tricky enough to be interesting
but not so hard that they defeat us...

There is absolutely no hope of achieving flow
if you spend your time waiting for a slow test suite to run.
Anything longer than a few seconds and you're going to let your attention wander,
you context-switch, and the flow state is gone.
And the flow state is a fragile dream.
Once it's gone, it takes a long time to come back.footnote:[
Some people says it takes at least 15 minutes to get back into the flow state.
In my experience, that's overblown,
and I sometimes wonder if it's thanks to TDD.
I think TDD reduces the cognitive load of programming.
By breaking our work down into small increments,
by simplifying our thinking "what's the current failing test?
what's the simplest code I can write to make it pass?",
it's often actually quite easy to context-switch back into coding.
Maybe it's less true for the times when we're
doing design work and thinking about what the abstractions in our code should be thogh.
But also there's absolutely no hope for you
if you've gone off to check social media while your tests run.
See you in 20-minutes to an hour!]


*******************************************************************************


==== We're not Getting the Full Potential Benefits of Testing


TDD gurus often say "it should be called test-driven _design_,
not test-driven development".  What do they mean by that?

We have definitely seen a bit of the positive influence of TDD on our design.
We've talked about how our tests are the first clients of any API we create,
and we've talked about the benefits of "programming by wishful thinking"
and outside-in.

But there's more to it.
These same TDD gurus also often say that you should "listen to your tests".
Unless you've read
https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/appendix_purist_unit_tests.html[Online Appendix: Test Isolation and "Listening to Your Tests"],
that will still sound like a bit of a mystery.

So, how can we get to a position where our tests are giving us maximum feedback
on our design?



=== The Ideal of the Test Pyramid

I know I said I didn't want to get bogged down into arguments based on definitions,
but let's set out the way people normally think about these three types of tests:

Functional/End-to-end tests::
    FTs check that the system works end-to-end,
    exercising the full stack of the application,
    including all dependencies and connected external systems.
    They are the ultimate test that it all hangs together,
    and that things are "really" going to work.


Integration tests::
    The purpose of an integration tests should be to checks that the code
    you write is integrated correctly with some "external" system or dependency.


(True) Unit tests::
    Unit tests are the lowest-level tests,
    and are supposed to test a single "unit" of code or behaviour.
    The ideal unit test is fully isolated
    from everything external to the unit under test
    such that changes to things outside cannot break the test.

The canonical advice is that you should aim to have the majority of your tests
be unit tests, with a smaller number of integration tests,
and an even smaller number of functional tests,
as in the classic "Test Pyramid" of <<test_pyramid>>.

[[test_pyramid]]
.The Test Pyramid
image::images/test_pyramid.png["A Pyramid shape, with a large bottom layer of unit tests, a medium layer of integration tests, and a small peak of FTs"]


Bottom Layer: Unit Tests (the vast majority)::
    These isolated tests are fast and pinpoint failures precisely.
    We want these to cover the majority of our functionality,
    and the entirety of our business logic if possible

Middle Layer: Integration Tests (a significant portion)::
    In an ideal world, these are reserved purely for testing the interactions
    between our code and external systems, like the database,
    or even (arguably) Django itself.
    These are slower, but they give us the confidence that our components
    work together.

Top Layer: A minimal set of Functional/End-to-End Tests::
    These tests are there to give us the ultimate reassurance
    that everything works end-to-end and top to bottom.
    But because they are the slowest and most brittle,
    we want as few of them as possible.


.On Acceptance Tests
*******************************************************************************

What about "acceptance" tests?  You might have heard this term bandied about.
Often people use it to mean the same thing as functional tests or end-to-end tests.

But as taught to me by one of the legends of QA at MADE (hi Marta!),
_any_ kind of test can be an acceptance test,
if it maps onto one of your acceptance criteria.

The point of an acceptance test is to validate a piece of behaviour
that's important to the user.
In our application, that's how we've been thinking about our FTs.

But, ultimately, using FTs to test every single piece of user-relevant functionality
is not sustainable.
We need to figure out ways to have our integration tests
and unit tests do the work of verifying user-visible behaviour,
understood at the right level of abstraction.

*******************************************************************************


=== Avoiding Mock Hell

Well that's all very well Harry, you might say,
but our current test setup is nothing like this!
How do we get there from _here_?

We've seen how to use mocks to isolate ourselves from external dependencies.
Are they the solution then?

As I was at pains to point out the mocking chapters,
the use of mocks comes with painful trade-offs.

* They make tests harder to read and write.
* They leave your tests tightly coupled to implementation details.
* As a result, they tend to impede refactoring.
* And in the extreme, you can sometimes end up with mocks testing mocks,
  almost entirely disconnected from what the code actually does.

Ed Jung calls this https://youtu.be/CdKaZ7boiZ4[Mock Hell].

This isn't to say that mocks are always bad!
But just that, from experience,
attempting to use them as your primary tool for decoupling
your tests from external dependencies is not a viable solution;
it carries costs that often outweigh the benefits.

NOTE: I'm glossing over the use of mocks in a "London-school"
    approach to TDD. See
    https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/appendix_purist_unit_tests.html[Online Appendix: Test Isolation and "Listening to Your Tests"].


=== The Actual Solutions Are Architectural

The actual solution to the problem isn't obvious from where we're standing,
but it actually lies in rethinking the architecture of our application.
In brief, if we can _decouple_ the core business logic of our application
from its dependencies, then we can write true unit tests for it,
that do not depend on those, um, dependencies.

Integration tests are most necessary at the _boundaries_ of a system--at
the points where our code integrates with external systems,
like the database, filesystem, network, or a UI.

Similarly, it's at the boundaries that the downsides of test isolation and
mocks are at their worst, because it's at the boundaries that you're most
likely to be annoyed if your tests are tightly coupled to an implementation,
or to need more reassurance that things are integrated properly.

Conversely, code at the _core_ of our application--code
that's purely concerned with our business domain and business rules,
code that's entirely under our control--has no intrinsic need
for integration tests.

So the way to get what we want is to minimise the amount of our code
that has to deal with boundaries.
Then we test our core business logic with unit tests,
and test the rest with integration and functional tests.

But how do we do that?


.Time for a Plug!  Read more in "Cosmic Python"
*******************************************************************************

As I arrived at the end of writing this book,
I realised that I was going to have to learn about these architectural solutions,
and it was at MADE.com that I met Bob Gregory who was to become my co-author.
There we explored "ports and adapters" and related architectures,
which were quite rare at the time in the Python World.

So if you'd like a take on these architectural patterns
with a Pythonic twist,
check out https://www.cosmicpython.com[Architecture Patterns with Python],
which we subtitled "Cosmic Python",
because "Cosmos" is the opposite of "Chaos", in Greek.

*******************************************************************************


==== Ports and Adapters/Hexagonal/Onion/Clean Architecture

The classic solutions to this problem from the OO world
come under different names, but they're all variations on the same trick:
identifying the boundaries, creating an interface to define that boundary,
and then using that interface at test-time to swap out fake versions of your real dependencies.

Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce, in their book
<<GOOSGBT, _Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests_>>,
call this approach "Ports and Adapters" (see <<ports-and-adapters>>).

[[ports-and-adapters]]
.Ports and Adapters (diagram by Nat Pryce)
image::images/twp2_2601.png["Illustration of ports and adapaters architecture, with isolated core and integration points"]

This pattern, or variations on it, are known as
"Hexagonal Architecture" (by Alistair Cockburn),
"Clean Architecture" (by Robert C. Martin, aka Uncle Bob),
or "Onion Architecture" (by Jeffrey Palermo).


==== Functional Core, Imperative Shell

Gary Bernhardt pushes this further,
recommending an architecture he calls "Functional Core, Imperative Shell",
whereby the "shell" of the application,
the place where interaction with boundaries happens,
follows the imperative programming paradigm, and can be tested by integration tests,
functional tests, or even (gasp!) not at all, if it's kept minimal enough.

But the core of the application is actually written
following the functional programming paradigm
(complete with the "no side effects" corollary),
which allows fully isolated, "pure" unit tests, _without any mocks or fakes_.

Check out Gary's presentation titled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOYal8elnZk["Boundaries"] for more on this
approach.


==== The Central Conceit: These Architectures are "Better"

These patterns do not come for free!
Introducing the extra indirection and abstraction can add complexity to your code.
In fact, the creator of Rails, David Heinemeier Hansson,
has a famous blog post where he describes these architectures as
https://dhh.dk/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html[test-induced design damage].
That post eventually led to quite a thoughtful and nuanced discussion between DHH,
Martin Fowler and Kent Beck,
which you can follow https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/[here].

Like any technique, these patterns can be misused,
but I wanted to make the case for the upside of these patterns:
by making our software more testable,
we also make it more modular and maintainable.
We are forced to clearly separate our concerns,
and we make it easier to do things like upgrade our infrastructure when we need to.
This is the place where the "improved design" desideratum comes in.

TIP: Making our software more testable,
  also often leads to a better design.


.Testing In Production
*******************************************************************************
I should also make a brief mention of the power of observability and monitoring.

Kent Beck tells a story about his first few weeks at Facebook,
when one of the first tests he wrote turned out to be flaky in the build.
Someone just deleted it.  Shocked and asking why,
he was told "We know production is up. Your test is just producing noise, we don't need it".
footnote:[There's a transcript of this story here: https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SEDFB15-Facebook-Process-Kent-Beck.pdf]


Facebook has such confidence in its production monitoring and observability,
that it can provide them most of the feedback they need about whether the system is working.

Not everywhere is Facebook!  But it's a good indication that automated tests
aren't the be-all and end-all.
*******************************************************************************


=== The Hardest Part: Knowing When to Make the Switch


[[frog_in_a_pot]]
.When is it Time to Hop Out?
image::images/frog-in-a-pan-placeholder.png["An illustration of a frog being slowly boiled in a pan"]

* TODO: update image

For small to medium-sized applications, as we've seen, the Django test runner
and the integration tests it encourages us to write are just fine.

The problem is knowing when it's time to make the change
to a more decoupled architecture, and start striving explicitly for the Test Pyramid.

It's hard to give good advice here,
since I've only experienced environments where either someone else made the decision
before I joined, or the company is already struggling with a point where it's
(at least arguably) too late.

Another is, the longer you leave it, the harder it is.

Yet another is, because the pain is only going to set in gradually,
like the apocryphal boiled frogs, you're unlikely to notice
until you're past the "perfect" moment to switch.

One more suspicion:  it's never going to be a convenient _time_ to switch.
This is one of those things, like tech debt,
that are always going to struggle to justify themselves in the face of more
immediate priorities.

So perhaps one strategy would be an Odysseus pact,
tie yourself to the mast, and make a commitment--while the tests are still fast--to
set a "red line" for when to switch.
"if the tests ever take more than 10 seconds to run locally,
then it's time to rethink the architecture".


I'm not saying 10 seconds is the right number by the way.
I know plenty of people who are perfectly happy to wait 30 seconds.
And I know Gary Bernhardt, for one, would get very nervous
at a test suite that takes more than 100ms.

But I think the idea of drawing that line in the sand, wherever it is,
_before_ you get there, might be a good way to fight the "boiled frog" problem.

Failing all of that, if the best time to make the change was "ages ago",
then the second best time is "right now".

Other than that I can only wish you good luck,
and hope that by warning you of the dangers,
you'll keep an eye on your test suite,
and spot the problems before they get too large.



=== Wrap-Up

In this book, I've been able to show you how to use TDD,
and talk a bit about why we do it, and what makes a good test,
but we're inevitably limited by the scope of the project.

What that's meant is that some of the more advanced uses of TDD,
particularly the interplay between testing and architecture,
have been beyond the scope of this book.
But I hope that this chapter has given you enough of a guide to find your way
around that topic as your career progresses.
