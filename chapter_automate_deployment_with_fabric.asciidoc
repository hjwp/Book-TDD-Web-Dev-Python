Automating Deployment with Fabric
---------------------------------

[quote, 'Cay Horstman']

Automate, automate, automate.
______________________________________________________________

((("deployment", "automating with Fabric", id="Dfarbric11")))((("infrastructure as code")))Automating
deployment is critical for our staging tests to mean anything.
By making sure the deployment procedure is repeatable, we give ourselves
assurances that everything will go well when we deploy to production. (These
days people sometimes use the words "infrastructure as code" to describe
automation of deployments, and provisioning.)

((("Fabric", "installation and setup")))Fabric
is a tool which lets you automate commands that you want to run on
servers.  "fabric3" is the Python 3 fork:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *pip install fabric3*
----


TIP: It's safe to ignore any errors that say "failed building wheel" during
    the Fabric3 installation, as long as it says "Successfully installed..."
    at the end.


The usual setup is to have a file called 'fabfile.py', which will
contain one or more functions that can later be invoked from a command-line
tool called `fab`, like this:

[role="skipme"]
----
fab function_name:host=SERVER_ADDRESS
----

That will call `function_name`, passing in a connection to the server at
`SERVER_ADDRESS`.  There are lots of other options for specifying usernames and
passwords, which you can find out about using `fab --help`.

Breakdown of a Fabric Script for Our Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Fabric", "deployment script", id="Fscript11")))The
best way to see how it works is with an example.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/bluepeter/valpetejohn/trivia.shtml[Here's one
I made earlier], automating all the deployment steps we've been going through.
The main function is called `deploy`; that's the one we'll invoke from the
command line. It then calls out to several helper functions, which we'll build
together one by one, explaining as we go.


[role="sourcecode"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l001)
====
[source,python]
----
import random
from fabric.contrib.files import append, exists
from fabric.api import cd, env, local, run

REPO_URL = 'https://github.com/hjwp/book-example.git'  #<1>

def deploy():
    site_folder = f'/home/{env.user}/sites/{env.host}'  #<2>
    run(f'mkdir -p {site_folder}') <3><4>
    with cd(site_folder):  #<5>
        _get_latest_source()
        _update_virtualenv()
        _create_or_update_dotenv()
        _update_static_files()
        _update_database()
----
====

<1> You'll want to update the `REPO_URL` variable with the URL of your
    own Git repo on its code-sharing site.

<2> `env.user` will contain the username you're using to log in to the server;
    `env.host` will be the address of the server we've specified at the command
    line (e.g., 'superlists.ottg.eu').footnote:[If you're
    wondering why we're building up paths manually with f-strings instead of
    the `os.path.join` command we saw earlier, it's because `path.join` will
    use backslashes if you run the script from Windows, but we definitely want
    forward slashes on the server. That's a common gotcha!]

<3> `run` is the most common Fabric command.  It says "run this shell command
    on the server".  The `run` commands in this chapter will replicate many
    of the commands we did manually in the last two.

<4> `mkdir -p` is a useful flavour of `mkdir`, which is better in two ways: it 
    can create directories several levels deep, and it only creates them 
    if necessary.  So, `mkdir -p /tmp/foo/bar` will create the directory 'bar'
    but also its parent directory 'foo' if it needs to.  It also won't complain
    if 'bar' already exists.

<5> `cd` is a fabric context manager that says "run all the following
    statements inside this working directory".footnote:[You may be
    wondering why we didn't just use `run` to do the `cd`. It's because Fabric
    doesn't store any state from one command to the next--each `run` command
    runs in a separate shell session on the server.]

Hopefully all of those helper functions have fairly self-descriptive names.
Because any function in a fabfile can theoretically be invoked from the
command line, I've used the convention of a leading underscore to indicate
that they're not meant to be part of the "public API" of the fabfile. Let's
take a look at each one, in chronological order.


Pulling Down Our Source Code with Git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Next we want to download the latest version of our source code to the server,
like we did with `git pull` in the previous chapters:

[role="sourcecode"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l003)
====
[source,python]
----
def _get_latest_source():
    if exists('.git'):  #<1>
        run('git fetch')  #<2>
    else:
        run(f'git clone {REPO_URL} .')  #<3>
    current_commit = local("git log -n 1 --format=%H", capture=True)  #<4>
    run(f'git reset --hard {current_commit}')  #<5>
----
====

<1> `exists` checks whether a directory or file already exists on the server.
    We look for the '.git' hidden folder to check whether the repo has already
    been cloned in our site folder.

<2> `git fetch` inside an existing repository pulls down all the latest commits
    from the web (it's like `git pull`, but without immediately updating the
    live source tree).

<3> Alternatively we use `git clone` with the repo URL to bring down a fresh
    source tree.

<4> Fabric's `local` command runs a command on your local machine--it's just
    a wrapper around `subprocess.call` really, but it's quite convenient.
    Here we capture the output from that `git log` invocation to get the ID
    of the current commit that's on your local PC.  That means the server
    will end up with whatever code is currently checked out on your machine
    (as long as you've pushed it up to the server.  Another common gotcha!).

<5> We `reset --hard` to that commit, which will blow away any current changes
    in the server's code directory.

The end result of this is that we either do a `git clone` if it's a fresh
deploy, or we do a `git fetch + git reset --hard` if a previous version of
the code is already there; the equivalent of the `git pull` we used when we
did it manually, but with the `reset --hard` to force overwriting any local
changes.


Updating the Virtualenv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we create or update the virtualenv:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l004)
====
[source,python]
----
def _update_virtualenv():
    if not exists('.venv/bin/pip'):  #<1>
        run(f'python3.12 -m venv .venv')
    run('./.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt')  #<2>
----
====


<1> We look inside the virtualenv folder for the `pip` executable as a way of
    checking whether it already exists.

<2> Then we use `pip install -r` like we did earlier.



Creating a New .env File if Necessary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our deploy script can also save us some of the manual work creating a _.env_ script:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l005)
====
[source,python]
----
def _create_or_update_dotenv():
    append('.env', 'DJANGO_DEBUG_FALSE=y')  #<1>
    append('.env', f'SITENAME={env.host}')
    current_contents = run('cat .env')  #<2>
    if 'DJANGO_SECRET_KEY' not in current_contents:  #<2>
        new_secret = ''.join(random.SystemRandom().choices(  #<3>
            'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789', k=50
        ))
        append('.env', f'DJANGO_SECRET_KEY={new_secret}')
----
====

<1> The `append` command conditionally adds a line to a file,
    if that line isn't already there.

<2> For the secret key we first manually check whether there's already an entry
    in the file...

<3> And if not, we use our little one-liner from earlier to generate
    a new one (we can't rely on the ++append++'s conditional logic here
    because our new key and any potential existing one won't be the same).



Updating Static Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updating static files is a single command:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l006)
====
[source,python]
----
def _update_static_files():
    run('./.venv/bin/python manage.py collectstatic --noinput')  #<1>
----
====

<1> We use the virtualenv version of Python whenever we need to run a Django 
    'manage.py' command, to make sure we get the virtualenv version of Django,
    not the system one.



Migrating the Database If Necessary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Finally, we update the database with `manage.py migrate`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.deploy_tools/fabfile.py (ch09l007)
====
[source,python]
----
def _update_database():
    run('./.venv/bin/python manage.py migrate --noinput')  #<1>
----
====

<1> The `--noinput` removes any interactive yes/no confirmations that Fabric
    would find hard to deal with.


And we're done!  Lots of new things to take in, I imagine, but I hope you
can see how this is all replicating the work we did manually earlier, with
a bit of logic to make it work both for brand new deployments and for existing
ones that just need updating. If you like words with Latin roots, you might
describe it as 'idempotent', which means it has the same effect whether you
run it once or multiple times.((("", startref="Fdeploy11")))


Trying It Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before we try, we need to make sure our latest commits are up on GitHub,
or we won't be able to sync the server with our local commits.

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git push*
----

((("Fabric", "running on staging site", id="Fstage11")))Now let's try
our Fabric script out on our existing staging site, and see it working to
update a deployment that already exists:

// note this part of the test will fail if there's nothing new in the
// branch to `git pull`, there will be no "Counting object"

Awesome.  I love making computers spew out pages and pages of output like that
(in fact I find it hard to stop myself from making little '70s computer
__<brrp, brrrp, brrrp>__ noises like Mother in __Alien__).  If we look through
it we can see it is doing our bidding: the `mkdir -p` command goes through
happily, even though the directory already exist.  Next `git pull` pulls down
the couple of commits we just made.  Then `pip install -r requirements.txt`
completes happily, noting that the existing virtualenv already has all the
packages we need. `collectstatic` also notices that the static files are all
already there, and finally the `migrate` completes without needing to apply
anything.

NOTE: For this script to work, you need to have done a `git push` of your
    current local commit, so that the server can pull it down and `reset` to
    it. If you see an error saying `Could not parse object`, try doing a `git
    push`.



.Fabric Configuration
*******************************************************************************
((("Fabric", "configuration")))If
you are using an SSH key to log in, are storing it in the default location,
and are using the same username on the server as locally, then Fabric should
"just work".  If you aren't, there are several tweaks you may need to apply
in order to get the `fab` command to do your bidding. They revolve around the
username, the location of the SSH key to use, or the password.

You can pass these in to Fabric at the command line.  Check out:

'Brrp brrp brpp'. You can see the script follows a slightly different path,
doing a `git clone` to bring down a brand new repo instead of a `git pull`.
It also needs to set up a new virtualenv from scratch, including a fresh
install of pip and Django. The `collectstatic` actually creates new files this
time, and the `migrate` seems to have worked too.



Provisioning: Nginx and Gunicorn Config Using sed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("Nginx", "configuring using sed")))((("Gunicorn", "configuring using sed")))((("sed (stream editor)")))What
else do we need to do to get our live site into production? We refer to
our provisioning notes, which tell us to use the template files to create our
Nginx virtual host and the Systemd service.


Now let's use a little Unix command-line magic!

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *cat ./deploy_tools/nginx.template.conf \
    | sed "s/DOMAIN/superlists.ottg.eu/g" \
    | sudo tee /etc/nginx/sites-available/superlists.ottg.eu*
----

`sed` ("stream editor") takes a stream of text and performs edits on it.
In this case we ask it to substitute the string 'DOMAIN' for the address of our
site, with the `s/replaceme/withthis/g`
syntax.footnote:[You might have seen nerdy people using this strange
s/change-this/to-this/ notation on the internet.  Now you know why!]
`cat` prints out our file, and we pipe (`|`) that to our `sed` process,
and then we pipe the output of _that_ to a root-user process (`sudo`), which
uses `tee` to write its input to a file, in this case the Nginx
+sites-available+ virtualhost config file.  Wee!

Next we activate that file with a symlink:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/superlists.ottg.eu \
    /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/superlists.ottg.eu*
----

And we write the Systemd service, with another `sed`:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server: *cat ./deploy_tools/gunicorn-systemd.template.service \
    | sed "s/DOMAIN/superlists.ottg.eu/g" \
    | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn-superlists.ottg.eu.service*
----

Finally we start both services:

[role="server-commands"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
elspeth@server:$ *sudo systemctl daemon-reload*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo systemctl reload nginx*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo systemctl enable gunicorn-superlists.ottg.eu*
elspeth@server:$ *sudo systemctl start gunicorn-superlists.ottg.eu*
----

And we take a look at our site: <<working-production-deploy>>.  It
works--hooray!

[[working-production-deploy]]
.Brrp, brrp, brrp...it worked!
image::images/twp2_1101.png["A screenshot of the production site, working"]


It's done a good job.  Good fabfile, have a biscuit.  You have earned the
privilege of being added to the repo:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git add deploy_tools/fabfile.py*
$ *git commit -m "Add a fabfile for automated deploys"*
----


Git Tag the Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


((("Git", "tagging releases")))One
final bit of admin.  In order to preserve a historical marker,
we'll use Git tags to mark the state of the codebase that reflects
what's currently live on the server:

[role="skipme"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git tag LIVE*
$ *export TAG=$(date +DEPLOYED-%F/%H%M)*  # this generates a timestamp
$ *echo $TAG* # should show "DEPLOYED-" and then the timestamp
$ *git tag $TAG*
$ *git push origin LIVE $TAG* # pushes the tags up
----

Now it's easy, at any time, to check what the difference is between
our current codebase and what's live on the servers.  This will come
in useful in a few chapters, when we look at database migrations. Have
a look at the tag in the history:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git log --graph --oneline --decorate*
[...]
----


Anyway, you now have a live website!  Tell all your friends!  Tell your mum, if
no one else is interested!  And, in the next chapter, it's back to coding
again.((("", startref="Fstage11")))

((("Fabric", "additional resources")))((("automated deployment", "additional resources")))There's
no such thing as the One True Way in deployment, and I'm no grizzled
expert in any case.  I've tried to set you off on a reasonably sane path, but
there's plenty of things you could do differently, and lots, lots more to learn
besides.  Here are some resources I used for inspiration:

Automating Provisioning with Ansible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For some ideas on how you might go about automating the provisioning step,
and an alternative to Fabric called Ansible, go check out <<appendix3>>.


[role="pagebreak-before less_space"]
.Automated Deployments
*******************************************************************************

Fabric::
    ((("automated deployment", "best practices for")))((("Fabric", "automated deployment best practices")))Fabric
lets you run commands on servers from inside Python scripts. This
    is a great tool for automating server admin tasks.
    

Idempotency::
    ((("idempotency")))If
your deployment script is deploying to existing servers, you need to
    design them so that they work against a fresh installation 'and' against
    a server that's already configured.
    

Keep config files under source control::
    Make sure your only copy of a config file isn't on the server!  They
    are critical to your application, and should be under version control
    like anything else.

Automating provisioning::
    Ultimately, 'everything' should be automated, and that includes spinning up
    brand new servers and ensuring they have all the right software installed.
    This will involve interacting with the API of your hosting provider.

Configuration management tools::
    ((("configuration management tools")))((("Ansible")))((("Vagrant")))Fabric
is very flexible, but its logic is still based on scripting. More
    advanced tools take a more "declarative" approach, and can make your life
    even easier.  Ansible and Vagrant are two worth checking out (see
    <<appendix3>>), but there are many more (Chef, Puppet, Salt, Juju...).((("", startref="Dfarbric11")))
