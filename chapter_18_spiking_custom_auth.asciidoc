== User Authentication, Spiking, and [keep-together]#De-Spiking#

.Warning, Recently Updated
*******************************************************************************

🚧 This chapter has recently been updated for the third edition.
Its listings now use Django 5.1 and Python 3.12.

Please send feedback!  obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com

*******************************************************************************

((("authentication", id="AuthSpike18")))
Our beautiful lists site has been live for a few days,
and our users are starting to come back to us with feedback.
"We love the site", they say, "but we keep losing our lists.
Manually remembering URLs is hard.
It'd be great if it could remember what lists we'd started".

// Sara: Note to Harry for practice
// Sara: Note 2

Remember Henry Ford and faster horses. Whenever you hear a user requirement,
it's important to dig a little deeper
and think--what is the real requirement here?
And how can I make it involve a cool new technology I've been wanting to try out?

Clearly the requirement here
is that people want to have some kind of user account on the site.
So, without further ado, let's dive into authentication.

((("passwords")))
Naturally we're not going to mess about
with remembering passwords ourselves--besides being _so_ '90s,
secure storage of user passwords is a security nightmare
we'd rather leave to someone else.
We'll use something fun called passwordless auth instead.

(If you _insist_ on storing your own passwords,
Django's default auth module is ready and waiting for you.
It's nice and straightforward, and I'll leave it to you to discover on your own.)

=== Passwordless Auth With "Magic Links"



((("authentication", "passwordless")))
((("magic links")))
((("Oauth")))
((("Openid")))
What authentication system could we use to avoid storing passwords ourselves?
Oauth?  Openid?  "Login with Facebook"?   Ugh.
For me those all have unacceptable creepy overtones;
why should Google or Facebook know what sites you're logging into and when?

In the first edition I used an experimental project called "Persona",
cooked up by a some of the wonderful techno-hippy-idealists at Mozilla,
but sadly that project was abandoned.

Instead, for the second edition,
I found a fun approach to authentication
that now goes by the name of "Magic Links",
but you might call it "just use email".

The system was invented (or at least popularised) back in 2014
by someone annoyed at having to create new passwords for so many websites.
They found themselves just using random, throwaway passwords,
not even trying to remember them, and using the "forgot my password" feature
whenever he needed to log in again.
You can
https://medium.com/@ninjudd/passwords-are-obsolete-9ed56d483eb#.cx8iber30[read
all about it on Medium].

The concept is:  just use email to verify someone's identity.
If you're going to have a "forgot my password" feature,
then you're trusting email anyway, so why not just go the whole hog?
Whenever someone wants to log in,
we generate a unique URL for them to use, email it to them,
and they then click through that to get into the site.

It's by no means a perfect system,
and in fact there are lots of subtleties to be thought through
before it would really make a good login solution for a production website,
but this is just a fun toy project so let's give it a go.


=== A Somewhat Larger Spike

((("django-allauth")))
((("python-social-auth")))
To get this Magic Links project set up, the first thing I did was take a look at existing Python and Django authentication
packages, like https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/[django-allauth]
and https://github.com/omab/python-social-auth[python-social-auth],
but both of them looked overcomplicated for this stage
(and besides, it'll be more fun to code our own!).

So instead I dived in and hacked about, and after a few dead ends and wrong turns,
I had something which just about works.
I'll take you on a tour,
and then we'll go through and "de-spike" the implementation--that is,
replace the prototype with tested, production-ready code.

You should go ahead and add this code to your own site too,
and then you can have a play with it. 
Try logging in with your own email address,
and convince yourself that it really does work.



==== Starting a Branch for the Spike

((("spiking and de-spiking", "branching your VCS")))
((("Git", "creating branches")))
This spike is going to be a bit more involved that the last one,
so we'll be a little more rigorous with our version control.

Before embarking on a spike it's a good idea to start a new branch,
so you can still use your VCS without worrying about
your spike commits getting mixed up with your production code:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git checkout -b passwordless-spike*
----

Let's keep track of some of the things we're hoping to learn from the
spike:

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* _How to send emails_
* _Generating and recognising unique tokens_
* _How to authenticate someone in Django_
* _What steps will the user have to go through?_
*****


==== Frontend Log in UI


((("authentication", "frontend log in UI")))
Let's start with the frontend, hacking in
an actual form to be able to enter your email address into the navbar,
and a logout link for users who are already authenticated:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/templates/base.html (ch18l001)
====
[source,html]
----
  <body>
    <div class="container">

      <div class="navbar">
        {% if user.is_authenticated %}
          <p>Logged in as {{ user.email }}</p>
          <form method="POST" action="/accounts/logout">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <button id="id_logout" type="submit">Log out</button>
          </form>
        {% else %}
          <form method="POST" action ="accounts/send_login_email">
            Enter email to log in: <input name="email" type="text" />
            {% csrf_token %}
          </form>
        {% endif %}
      </div>

      <div class="row justify-content-center p-5 bg-body-tertiary rounded-3">
      [...]

==== Sending Emails from Django

((("authentication", "sending emails from Django", id="SDemail18")))
((("Django framework", "sending emails", id="DFemail18")))
((("send_mail function", id="sendmail18")))
((("emails, sending from Django", id="emails18")))
The login theory will be something like this:

- When someone wants to log in, we generate a unique secret token for them,
  store it in the database linked to their email, and send it to them.

- The user then checks their email,
  which will have a link to a URL that includes that token.

- When they click that link, we check whether the token exists in database,
  and if so, they are logged in as the associated user.

// https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/customizing/


First let's prep an app for our accounts stuff:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *cd src && python manage.py startapp accounts*
----
//16l002

And we'll wire up _urls.py_ with at least one URL.
In the top-level _superlists/urls.py_...

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/urls.py (ch18l003)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.urls import include, path
from lists import views as list_views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", list_views.home_page, name="home"),
    path("lists/", include("lists.urls")),
    path("accounts/", include("accounts.urls")),
]
----
====

And in the accounts module's 'urls.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/urls.py (ch18l004)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.urls import path

from accounts import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("send_login_email", views.send_login_email, name="send_login_email"),
]
----
====

Here's the view that's in charge of creating a token
associated with the email address the user puts in our login form:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/views.py (ch18l005)
====
[source,python]
----
import sys
import uuid

from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.shortcuts import render

from accounts.models import Token


def send_login_email(request):
    email = request.POST["email"]
    uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
    Token.objects.create(email=email, uid=uid)
    print("saving uid", uid, "for email", email, file=sys.stderr)
    url = request.build_absolute_uri(f"/accounts/login?uid={uid}")
    send_mail(
        "Your login link for Superlists",
        f"Use this link to log in:\n\n{url}",
        "noreply@superlists",
        [email],
    )
    return render(request, "login_email_sent.html")
----
====


For that to work we'll need a template with a placeholder message confirming the email was
sent:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/templates/login_email_sent.html (ch18l006)
====
[source,html]
----
<html>
<h1>Email sent</h1>

<p>Check your email, you'll find a message with a link that will log you into
the site.</p>

</html>
----
====

(You can see how hacky this code is--we'd want to integrate this template
with our 'base.html' in the real version.)

==== Email Server Config for Django

More importantly, for the Django `send_mail` function to work,
we need to tell Django our email server address.
I'm just using my Gmailfootnote:[
Didn't I just spend a whole intro banging on about the privacy implications
of using Google for login, only to go on and use Gmail?
Yes, it's a contradiction (honest, I will move off Gmail one day!).
But in this case I'm just using it for testing,
and the important thing is that I'm not forcing Google on my users.]
account for now.
You can use any email provider you like, as long as they support SMTP:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/settings.py (ch18l007)
====
[source,python]
----
EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "obeythetestinggoat@gmail.com"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get("EMAIL_PASSWORD")
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
----
====

((("Gmail")))
// SARA : Do you want this to appear as an actual tip box?
 
TIP: If you want to use Gmail as well,
    you'll probably have to visit your Google account security settings page.
    If you're using two-factor auth, you'll want to set up an
    https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords[app-specific password].
    If you're not, you will probably still need to
    https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps[allow access for less secure apps].
    You might want to consider creating a new Google account for this purpose,
    rather than using one containing sensitive data.

((("", startref="sendmail18")))
((("", startref="DFemail18")))
((("", startref="SDemail18")))

// https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/email/


==== Another Secret, Another Environment Variable

((("authentication", "avoiding secrets in source code")))
((("environment variables")))
Once again, we have a "secret"
that we want to avoid keeping directly in our source code or on GitHub,
so another environment variable gets used in the `os.environ.get`.

To get this to work,
we need to set it in the shell that's running my dev server:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *export EMAIL_PASSWORD="ur-email-server-password-here"*
----

Later we'll see about adding that to the env file
on the staging server as well.


==== Storing Tokens in the Database

((("authentication", "storing tokens in databases")))
((("tokens")))
How are we doing? Let's review where we're at in the process:

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* _[strikethrough line-through]#How to send emails#_
* _Generating and recognising unique tokens_
* _How to authenticate someone in Django_
* _What steps will the user have to go through?_
*****

We'll need a model to store our tokens in the database--they
link an email address with a unique ID.
Pretty simple:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/models.py (ch18l008)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.db import models


class Token(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()
    uid = models.CharField(max_length=255)
----
====

Yes, I know Django supports UID fields in databases,
but I just want to keep things simple for now.
The point of this spike is about authentication and emails,
not optimising database storage.
We've got enough things we need to learn as it is!


Let's switch on our new accounts app in _settings.py_:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/settings.py (ch18l008-1)
====
[source,python]
----
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "lists",
    "accounts",
]
----
====
//TODO; renumber listings

We can then do a quick migrations dance to add the token model to the db:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'accounts':
  src/accounts/migrations/0001_initial.py
    + Create model Token
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py migrate*]
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: accounts, auth, contenttypes, lists, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying accounts.0001_initial... OK
----
//ch18l008-2


And at this point, if you actually try the email form in your browser,
you'll see we can actually send email! See <<spike-email-sent>> and <<spike-email-received>>

[[spike-email-sent]]
.Looks like we might have sent an email
image::images/login-email-sent-page.png["The email sent confirmation page, indicating the server at least thinks it sent an email successfully"]

[[spike-email-received]]
.Yep looks like we received it
image::images/login-link-in-email.png["Screenshot of my email client showing the email from the server, saying 'your login link for superlist' and including a token url"]


==== Custom Authentication Models

((("authentication", "custom authentication models")))
Before the login will work end-to-end though,
we need to sort out user authentication in Django.
// SARA: not clear that you're striking through half a todo item. call it out in the text?
[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#How to send emails#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Generating# and recognising unique tokens'
* 'How to authenticate someone in Django'...
* 'What steps will the user have to go through?'
*****

The first thing we'll need is a user model.
I took a dive into the
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/customizing[Django
auth documentation] and tried to hack in the simplest possible one:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/models.py (ch18l009)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.contrib.auth.models import (
    AbstractBaseUser,
    BaseUserManager,
)
[...]


class ListUser(AbstractBaseUser):
    email = models.EmailField(primary_key=True)
    USERNAME_FIELD = "email"
    # REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['email', 'height']

    objects = ListUserManager()

    @property
    def is_staff(self):
        return self.email == "harry.percival@example.com"

    @property
    def is_active(self):
        return True
----
====

That's what I call a minimal user model!
One field, none of this firstname/lastname/username nonsense,
and, pointedly, no password!
Somebody else's problem!

But, again, you can see that this code isn't ready for production,
from the commented-out lines to the hardcoded harry email address.
We'll neaten this up quite a lot when we de-spike.


To get it to work, I needed to add a model manager for the user,
for some reason:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.src/accounts/models.py (ch18l010)
====
[source,python]
----
[...]
class ListUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email):
        ListUser.objects.create(email=email)

    def create_superuser(self, email, password):
        self.create_user(email)
----
====


No need to worry about what a model manager is at this stage;
for now we just need it because we need it, and it works.
When we de-spike, we'll examine each bit of code that actually ends up in production
and make sure we understand it fully.

We'll need another `makemigrations/migrate` to make the and user model real:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'accounts':
  src/accounts/migrations/0002_listuser.py
    + Create model ListUser
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py migrate*]
[...]
Running migrations:
  Applying accounts.0002_listuser... OK
----
/ch18l009-1


==== Finishing the Custom Django Auth

((("authentication", "custom Django authentication", id="SDcustom18")))
We're almost there--our last step combines recognising the token
and then actually logging the user in.
Once we've done this,
we'll be able to pretty much strike off all the items on our scratchpad:
//SARA again it's not clear whether we're changing the scratchpad or not?  how does it correspond to what we're actually doing?  could make a little gag here.
[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* _[strikethrough line-through]#How to send emails#_
* _[strikethrough line-through]#Generating# and recognising unique tokens_
* _How to authenticate someone in Django_
* _What steps will the user have to go through?_
*****

So here's the view that actually handles the click through from the link in the
email:

[role="sourcecode small-code"]
.src/accounts/views.py (ch18l011)
====
[source,python]
----
import sys
import uuid

from django.contrib.auth import authenticate
from django.contrib.auth import login as auth_login
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.shortcuts import redirect, render

from accounts.models import Token


def send_login_email(request):
    [...]


def login(request):
    print("login view", file=sys.stderr)
    uid = request.GET.get("uid")
    user = authenticate(request, uid=uid)
    if user is not None:
        auth_login(request, user)
    return redirect("/")
----
====


The `authenticate()` function invokes Django's authentication framework,
which we configure using a "custom authentication backend",
whose job it is to validate the UID and return a user with the right email.

We could have done this stuff directly in the view,
but we may as well structure things the way Django expects.
It makes for a reasonably neat separation of concerns:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/authentication.py (ch18l012)
====
[source,python]
----
import sys

from accounts.models import ListUser, Token

from django.contrib.auth.backends import BaseBackend


class PasswordlessAuthenticationBackend(BaseBackend):
    def authenticate(self, request, uid):
        print("uid", uid, file=sys.stderr)
        if not Token.objects.filter(uid=uid).exists():
            print("no token found", file=sys.stderr)
            return None
        token = Token.objects.get(uid=uid)
        print("got token", file=sys.stderr)
        try:
            user = ListUser.objects.get(email=token.email)
            print("got user", file=sys.stderr)
            return user
        except ListUser.DoesNotExist:
            print("new user", file=sys.stderr)
            return ListUser.objects.create(email=token.email)

    def get_user(self, email):
        return ListUser.objects.get(email=email)
----
====


Again, lots of debug prints in there, and some duplicated code,
not something we'd want in production, but it works...
as long as we add it to settings.py:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/settings.py (ch18l012-1)
====
[source,python]
----
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    [...]
    "accounts",
]

AUTH_USER_MODEL = "accounts.ListUser"
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    "accounts.authentication.PasswordlessAuthenticationBackend",
]

MIDDLEWARE = [
    [...]

----
====

And finally, a logout view:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/views.py (ch18l013)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate
from django.contrib.auth import login as auth_login
from django.contrib.auth import logout as auth_logout
[...]


def logout(request):
    auth_logout(request)
    return redirect("/")
----
====


Add login and logout to our _urls.py_...

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/urls.py (ch18l014)
====
[source,python]
----
urlpatterns = [
    path("send_login_email", views.send_login_email, name="send_login_email"),
    path("login", views.login, name="login"),
    path("logout", views.logout, name="logout"),
]
----
====



And we should be all done!
Spin up a dev server with `runserver` and try it--believe it or not,
it _acutally_ works:
(<<spike-login-worked>>).

[[spike-login-worked]]
.It works! It works! Mwahahahaha.
image::images/spike-it-worked-windows.png["screenshot of several windows including gmail and termainals but in the foreground our site showing us as being logged in."]

TIP: If you get an `SMTPSenderRefused` error message, don't forget to set
    the `EMAIL_PASSWORD` environment variable in the shell that's running
    `runserver`.


That's pretty much it!
Along the way, I had to fight pretty hard,
including clicking around the Gmail account security UI for a while,
stumbling over several missing attributes on my custom user model
(because I didn't read the docs properly),
and even at one point switching to the dev version of Django to overcome a bug,
which thankfully turned out to be a red herring.
((("", startref="SDcustom18")))


But we now have a working solution!  Let's commit it on our spike branch:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status*
$ *git add src/accounts*
$ *git commit -am "spiked in custom passwordless auth backend"*
----

Time to de-spike!



=== De-spiking

((("spiking and de-spiking", "de-spiking", id="SDde18")))
De-spiking means rewriting your prototype code using TDD.
We now have enough information to "do it properly".
So what's the first step?  An FT, of course!

We'll stay on the spike branch for now,
to see our FT pass against our spiked code.
Then we'll go back to our main branch and commit just the FT.

Here's a first, simple version of the FT:

class LoginTest(FunctionalTest):
    def test_login_using_magic_link(self):
        # Edith goes to the awesome superlists site
        # and notices a "Log in" section in the navbar for the first time
        # It's telling her to enter her email address, so she does
        self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
        self.browser.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "input[name=email]").send_keys(
            TEST_EMAIL, Keys.ENTER
        )

        # A message appears telling her an email has been sent
        self.wait_for(
            lambda: self.assertIn(

        email = mail.outbox.pop()  # <1>
        self.assertIn(TEST_EMAIL, email.to)
        self.assertEqual(email.subject, SUBJECT)

        # It has a URL link in it
        self.assertIn("Use this link to log in", email.body)
        url_search = re.search(r"http://.+/.+$", email.body)
        if not url_search:
            self.fail(f"Could not find url in email body:\n{email.body}")
        url = url_search.group(0)
        self.assertIn(self.live_server_url, url)

        # she clicks it
        self.browser.get(url)

        # she is logged in!
        self.wait_for(

        )
        navbar = self.browser.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".navbar")
        self.assertIn(TEST_EMAIL, navbar.text)
----
====

<1> Were you worried about how we were going to handle retrieving emails in our
    tests?  Thankfully we can cheat for now! When running tests, Django gives
    us access to any emails the server tries to send via the `mail.outbox`
    attribute. We'll discuss checking "real" emails in chapter ___.

// TODO: link to "later".


And if we run the FT, it works!

$ *rm -rf src/accounts* # remove any trace of spiked code
$ *git add src/functional_tests/test_login.py*
$ *git commit -m "FT for login via email"*
----

Now we rerun the FT and let it drive our development:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test functional_tests.test_login*]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate
element: input[name=email]; [...]
[...]
----

The first thing it wants us to do is add an email input element. Bootstrap has
some built-in classes for navigation bars, so we'll use them, and include a
form for the login email:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/templates/base.html (ch18l020)
====
[source,html]
----
<body>
  <div class="container">

    <nav class="navbar">
      <div class="container-fluid">
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">Superlists</a>
        <form method="POST" action="/accounts/send_login_email">
          <div class="input-group">
            <label class="navbar-text me-2" for="id_email_input">
              Enter your email to log in
            </label>
            <input
              id="id_email_input"
              name="email"
              class="form-control"
              placeholder="your@email.com"
            />
            {% csrf_token %}
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    </nav>


    <div class="row justify-content-center p-5 bg-body-tertiary rounded-3">
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">
        <h1 class="display-1 mb-4">{% block header_text %}{% endblock %}</h1>
        [...]
----
====


Now our FT fails because the login form doesn't send us to a real URL yet--you'll
see the `Not found:` message in the server output,
as well as the assertion reporting the content of the default 404 page:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test functional_tests.test_login*]
[...]
Not Found: /accounts/send_login_email
[...]
AssertionError: 'Check your email' not found in 'Not Found\nThe requested
resource was not found on this server.'
----

Time to start writing some Django code.
We begin, like in the spike, by creating an app called `accounts`
to hold all the files related to login:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *cd src && python manage.py startapp accounts*
----
//ch18l021


You could even do a commit just for that, to be able to distinguish the
placeholder app files from our modifications.

Next let's rebuild our minimal user model, with tests this time, and see
if it turns out neater than it did in the spike.
((("", startref="SDde18")))


// TODO: consider starting with a test for the login view instead.

=== A Minimal Custom User Model

((("authentication", "minimal custom user model", id="SDminimal18")))
Django's built-in user model makes all sorts of assumptions about
what information you want to track about users,
from explicitly recording first name and last namefootnote:[
A decision which you'll find prominent Django maintainers
saying they now regret.  Not everyone has a first name and a last name.]
to forcing you to use a username.
I'm a great believer in not storing information about users
unless you absolutely must,
so a user model that records an email address and nothing else
sounds good to me!

Let's start straight away with a tests folder instead of _tests.py_
in this app:

[subs=""]
----
$ <strong>rm src/accounts/tests.py</strong>
$ <strong>mkdir src/accounts/tests</strong>
$ <strong>touch src/accounts/tests/__init__.py</strong>
----

And now let's add add a _test_models.py_ to say:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/tests/test_models.py (ch18l023)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.test import TestCase

User = get_user_model()


class UserModelTest(TestCase):
    def test_user_is_valid_with_email_only(self):
        user = User(email="a@b.com")
        user.full_clean()  # should not raise
----
====


// todo: consider User.objects.create() here,
// depending on what we do about IntegrityErrors in chap 13


That gives us an expected failure:

[role=""]
----
django.core.exceptions.ValidationError: {'password': ['This field cannot be
blank.'], 'username': ['This field cannot be blank.']}
----

Password?  Username?  Bah!  How about this?


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/models.py (ch18l025)
====
[source,python]
----
from django.db import models


class User(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()
----
====


And we wire it up inside _settings.py_, adding `accounts` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
and a variable called `AUTH_USER_MODEL`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/superlists/settings.py (ch18l026)
====
[source,python]
----
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "lists",
    "accounts",
]

AUTH_USER_MODEL = "accounts.User"
----
====


Now when we run our tests, Django complains
that our custom user model is missing a couple of bits of metadata:


[role="ignore-errors"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test accounts*]
Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
    new_errors = check(app_configs=app_configs, databases=databases)
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File ".../django/contrib/auth/checks.py", line 46, in check_user_model
    if not isinstance(cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS, (list, tuple)):
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: type object 'User' has no attribute 'REQUIRED_FIELDS'
----


Sigh.  Come on, Django, it's only got one field,
so you should be able to figure out the answers to these questions for yourself.
Here you go:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/models.py (ch18l027)
====
[source,python]
----
class User(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()

    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []
----
====

Next silly question?footnote:[
You might ask, if I think Django is so silly,
why don't I submit a pull request to fix it?
Should be quite a simple fix.
Well, I promise I will, as soon as I've finished writing the book.
For now, snarky comments will have to suffice.]

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
AttributeError: type object 'User' has no attribute 'USERNAME_FIELD'
----

And we go through a few more of these, until we get to:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/models.py (ch18l029)
====
[source,python]
----
class User(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()

    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []
    USERNAME_FIELD = "email"
    is_anonymous = False
    is_authenticated = True
----
====


And now we get a slightly different error:


[role="ignore-errors"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test accounts*]
[...]
SystemCheckError: System check identified some issues:

ERRORS:
accounts.User: (auth.E003) 'User.email' must be unique because it is named as
the 'USERNAME_FIELD'.
----

Well, the simple way to fix that would be like this:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/models.py (ch18l030)
====
[source,python]
----
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
----
====

And now we get a different error again, slightly more familiar this time!
Django is a bit happier with the structure of our custom User model,
but it's unhappy about the database:

----
django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: accounts_user
----


In other words, we need to create a migration:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'accounts':
  src/accounts/migrations/0001_initial.py
    + Create model User
----
//ch18l031


And the test passes:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python src/manage.py test accounts*
[...]
Ran 1 tests in 0.001s
OK
----


But our model isn't quite as simple as it could be.
It has the email field, and also an autogenerated "ID" field as its primary key.
We could make it even simpler!



==== Tests as Documentation


((("tests as documentation")))
((("documentation")))
Let's go all the way and make the email field into the primary key,footnote:[
Emails may not be the perfect primary key IRL.
One reader, clearly deeply scarred,
wrote me an emotional email about how much they've suffered for over a decade
from trying to deal with the effects of email primary keys,
due to their making multiuser account management impossible.
So, as ever, YMMV.]
and thus implicitly remove the autogenerated `id` column.

Although we could just _do it_ and our test would still pass,
and conceivably claim it was "just a refactor",
it would be better to have a specific test:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/tests/test_models.py (ch18l032)
====
[source,python]
----
    def test_email_is_primary_key(self):
        user = User(email="a@b.com")
        self.assertEqual(user.pk, "a@b.com")
----
====

It'll help us remember if we ever come back and look at the code again
in future:

----
    self.assertEqual(user.pk, "a@b.com")
AssertionError: None != 'a@b.com'
----

TIP: Your tests can be a form of documentation for your code--they
    express what your requirements are of a particular class or function.
    Sometimes, if you forget why you've done something a particular way,
    going back and looking at the tests will give you the answer.
    That's why it's important to make your tests readable,
    including giving them explicit, verbose method names.

And here's the implementation (`primary_key` makes the `unique=True` obsolete):

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/models.py (ch18l033)
====
[source,python]
----
    email = models.EmailField(primary_key=True)
----
====


And we mustn't forget to adjust our migrations:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*rm src/accounts/migrations/0001_initial.py*]
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'accounts':
  src/accounts/migrations/0001_initial.py
    + Create model User
----
//ch18l034


((("", startref="SDminimal18")))
Now both our tests pass:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test accounts*]
[...]
Ran 2 tests in 0.001s
OK
----

It's probably a good time for a commit, too.


=== A Token Model to Link Emails with a Unique ID

((("authentication", "token model to link emails", id="SDtoken18")))
Next let's build a token model.
Here's a short unit test that captures the essence--you
should be able to link an email to a unique ID,
and that ID shouldn't be the same two times in a row:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/tests/test_models.py (ch18l035)
====
[source,python]
----
from accounts.models import Token
[...]


class TokenModelTest(TestCase):
    def test_links_user_with_auto_generated_uid(self):
        token1 = Token.objects.create(email="a@b.com")
        token2 = Token.objects.create(email="a@b.com")
        self.assertNotEqual(token1.uid, token2.uid)
----
====

I won't show every single listing for creating the Token class in _models.py_;
I'll let you do that yourself instead.
Driving Django models with basic TDD
involves jumping through a few hoops because of the migration,
so you'll see a few iterations like this--minimal code change,
make migrations, get new error, delete migrations,
re-create new migrations, another code change, and so on...


[role="dofirst-ch18l036"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test accounts*]
[...]
TypeError: Token() got unexpected keyword arguments: 'email'
----

I'll trust you to go through these conscientiously--remember,
I may not be able to see you, but the Testing Goat can!


[role="dofirst-ch18l037"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'accounts':
  src/accounts/migrations/0002_token.py
    + Create model Token
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test accounts*]
AttributeError: 'Token' object has no attribute 'uid'. Did you mean: 'id'?
$ pass:quotes[*rm src/accounts/migrations/0002_token.py*]
----


Eventually you should get to this code...

[role="sourcecode dofirst-ch18l038-0"]
.src/accounts/models.py (ch18l038)
====
[source,python]
----
class Token(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()
    uid = models.CharField(max_length=40)
----
====

And this error:

[role="dofirst-ch18l039"]
[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python src/manage.py test accounts*]
[...]

    self.assertNotEqual(token1.uid, token2.uid)
AssertionError: '' == ''
----

And here we have to decide how to generate our random unique ID field.
We could use the `random` module, but Python actually comes with another module
specifically designed for generating unique IDs called "uuid"
(for "universally unique id").

We can use uuid like this:


[role="sourcecode"]
.src/accounts/models.py (ch18l040)
====
[source,python]
----
import uuid
[...]

class Token(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField()
    uid = models.CharField(default=uuid.uuid4, max_length=40)
----
====


And, perhaps with a bit more wrangling of migrations,
that should get us to passing tests:


[role="dofirst-ch18l041"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python src/manage.py test accounts*
[...]
Ran 3 tests in 0.015s

OK
----



Well,  we are well on our way!
The models layer is done, at least.
In the next chapter, we'll get into mocking,
a key technique for testing external dependencies like email.

.Exploratory Coding, Spiking, and De-spiking
*******************************************************************************
Spiking::
    Exploratory coding to find out about a new API,
    or to explore the feasibility of a new solution.
    Spiking can be done without tests.
    It's a good idea to do your spike on a new branch,
    and go back to your main branch when de-spiking.
    ((("spiking and de-spiking", "defined")))


De-spiking::
    Taking the work from a spike and making it part of the production codebase.
    The idea is to throw away the old spike code altogether,
    and start again from scratch, using TDD once again.
    De-spiked code can often come out looking quite different
    from the original spike, and usually much nicer.


Writing your FT against spiked code::
    Whether or not this is a good idea depends on your circumstances.
    The reason it can be useful is because it can help you write the FT
    correctly--figuring out how to test your spike
    can be just as challenging as the spike itself.
    On the other hand, it might constrain you towards
    reimplementing a very similar solution to your spiked one;
    something to watch out for.
