Django Class-Based Views
------------------------

This appendix follows on from <<advanced-forms-chapter>>, in which we
implemented Django forms for validation, and refactored our views.  By the end
of that chapter, our views were still using functions.

The new shiny in the Django world, however, is class-based views. In this
chapter, we'll refactor our application to use them instead of view functions.
More specifically, we'll have a go at using class-based 'generic' views.


Class-based generic views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There's a difference between class-based views and class-based 'generic' views.
Class-based views are just another way of defining view functions.  They make
few assumptions about what your views will do, and they offer one main
advantage over view functions, which is that they can be subclassed.  This
comes, arguably, at the expense of being less readable than traditional
function-based views.  The main use case for 'plain' class-based views is when
you have several views that re-use the same logic. We want to obey the DRY
principle. With function-based views, you would use helper functions or
decorators.  The theory is that using a class structure may give you a more
elegant solution.

Class-based 'generic' views are class-based views that attempt to provide
ready-made solutions to common use cases:  fetching an object from the
database and passing it to a template, fetching a list of objects, saving
user input from a POST request using a ModelForm, and so on.  These sound very
much like our use cases, but as we'll soon see, the devil is in the detail.

I should say at this point that I've not used either kind of class-based views
much. I can definitely see the sense in them, and there are potentially many
use cases in Django apps where CBGVs would fit in perfectly. However, as soon
as your use case is slightly outside the basics -- as soon as you have more
than one model you want to use, for example, I find that using class-based
can (again, debatably) lead to code that's much harder to read than a classic
view function.  

Still, because we're forced to use several of the customisation options for
class-based views, implementing them in this case can teach us a lot about
how they work, and how we can unit tests them.

My hope is that the same unit tests we use for function-based views should
work just as well for class-based views.  Let's see how we get on.


The home page as a FormView
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our home page just displays a form on a template:

[source,python]
----
def home_page(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'form': ItemForm()})
----

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/class-based-views/[Looking through
the options], Django has a generic view called `FormView` -- let's see how that
goes:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch31l001)
[source,python]
----
from django.views.generic import FormView
[...]

class HomePageView(FormView):
    template_name = 'home.html'
    form_class = ItemForm
----

We tell it what template we want to use, and which form. Then, we
just need to update 'urls.py', replacing the line that used to say
`lists.views.home_page`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/urls.py (ch31l002)
[source,python]
----
    url(r'^$', HomePageView.as_view(), name='home'),
----

And the tests all check out! That was easy..

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test lists*]
[...]

Ran 34 tests in 0.119s
OK
----

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests*]
[...]

Ran 4 tests in 15.160s
OK
----

So far so good. We've replaced a 1-line view function with a 2-line class,
but it's still very readable. This would be a good time for a commit...


Using form_valid to customise a CreateView
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next we have a crack at the view we use to create a brand new list, currently
the `new_list` function. Here's what it looks like now:

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def new_list(request):
    form = ItemForm(data=request.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
        list = List.objects.create()
        form.save(for_list=list_)
        return redirect(list_)
    else:
        return render(request, 'home.html', {"form": form})
----


Looking through the possible CBGVs, we probably want a `CreateView`, and we
know we're using the `ItemForm` class, so let's see how we get on with them,
and whether the tests will help us:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch31l003)
[source,python]
----
from django.views.generic import FormView, CreateView
[...]

class NewListView(CreateView):
    form_class = ItemForm

def new_list(request):
    [...]
----

I'm going to leave the old view function in 'views.py', so that we can copy
code across from it.  We can delete it once everything is working.  It's
harmless as soon as we switch over the URL mappings, this time in:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/urls.py (ch31l004)
[source,python]
----
from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
from lists.views import NewListView

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^(\d+)/$', 'lists.views.view_list', name='view_list'),
    url(r'^new$', NewListView.as_view(), name='new_list'),
)
----

Now running the tests gives 3 errors:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test lists*]

ERROR: test_for_invalid_input_passes_form_to_template

Ran 34 tests in 0.125s

FAILED (errors=6)
----

Let's start with the third -- maybe we can just add the template?

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch31l005)
[source,python]
----
class NewListView(CreateView):
    form_class = ItemForm
    template_name = 'home.html'
----

That gets us down to just two failures:  We can see they're both happening
in the generiv view's `form_valid` function, and that's one of the ones that
you can override to provide custom behaviour in a CBGV.  As its name implies,
it's run when the view has detected a valid form.  We can just copy some of
the code from our old view function, that used to live after 
`if form.is_valid():`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch31l005)
[source,python]
----
class NewListView(CreateView):
    template_name = 'home.html'
    form_class = ItemForm

    def form_valid(self, form):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        form.save(for_list=list_)
        return redirect(list_)
----

That gets us a full pass!

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test lists*]
Ran 34 tests in 0.119s
OK
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests*]
Ran 4 tests in 15.157s
OK
----


And we 'could' even save two more lines, trying to obey "DRY", by using one of
the main advantages of CBVs: inheritance!

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch31l007)
[source,python]
----
class NewListView(CreateView, HomePageView):

    def form_valid(self, form):
        list = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(text=form.cleaned_data['text'], list=list)
        return redirect('/lists/%d/' % (list.id,))
----

And all the tests would still pass.

----
OK
----

WARNING: This is not really good object-oriented practice.  Inheritance implies
an "is-a" relationship, and it's probably not meaningful to say that our 
new list view "is-a" home page view... So, probably best not to do this //If they shouldn't be doing it then why are we telling them to and showing them how? I'd be annoyed as the reader if I just put effort into something only to find out I shouldn't ever do.  I'd suggest saying this before we do it: "I'm going to show you something that's bad practice, etc etc, don't do it, but so you get a visual" or whatever.

With or without that last step, how does it compare to the old version? I'd say
that's not bad.   We save some boilerplate code, and the view is still fairly
legible.  So far, I'd say we've got one point for CBGVs, and one draw.


A more complex view to handle both viewing and adding to a list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This took me 'several' attempts.  And I have to say that, although the tests
told me when I got it right, they didn't really help me to figure out the
steps to get there...  Mostly it was just trial and error, hacking about
in functions like `get_context_data`, `get_form_kwargs` and so on.

One thing it did made me realise was the value of having lots of individual
tests, each testing one thing.  I went back and re-wrote some of chapters 10-12
as a result.

The tests guide us, for a while
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here's how things might go.  Start by thinking we want a `DetailView`,
something that shows you the detail of an object:


[role="sourcecode dofirst-ch31l008"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
from django.views.generic import FormView, CreateView, DetailView
[...]

class ViewAndAddToList(DetailView):
    model = List
----

Gives:

----
[...]
AttributeError: Generic detail view ViewAndAddToList must be called with either
an object pk or a slug.

FAILED (failures=5, errors=6)
----

Not totally obvious, but a bit of Googling around led me to understand that
I needed to use a "named" regex capture group:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/urls.py (ch31l011)
[source,diff]
----
@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@
 from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
-from lists.views import NewListView
+from lists.views import NewListView, ViewAndAddToList
 
 urlpatterns = patterns('',
-    url(r'^(\d+)/$', 'lists.views.view_list', name='view_list'),
+    url(r'^(?P<pk>\d+)/$', ViewAndAddToList.as_view(), name='view_list'),
     url(r'^new$', NewListView.as_view(), name='new_list'),
 )
----

The next error was fairly helpful:

----
[...]
django.template.base.TemplateDoesNotExist: lists/list_detail.html

FAILED (failures=5, errors=6)
----

That's easily solved:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
class ViewAndAddToList(DetailView):
    model = List
    template_name = 'list.html'
----

That takes us down 3 errors:

----
[...]
ERROR: test_displays_item_form (lists.tests.test_views.ListViewTest)
KeyError: 'form'

FAILED (failures=5, errors=2)
----

Until we're left with trial and error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So I figured, our view doesn't just show us the detail of an object,
it also allows us to create new ones.  Let's make it both a 
`DetailView` 'and' a `CreateView`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
class ViewAndAddToList(DetailView, CreateView):
    model = List
    template_name = 'list.html'
    form_class = ExistingListItemForm
----

But that gives us a lot of errors saying:

----
[...]
TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'for_list'
----

And the `KeyError: 'form'` was still there too!

At this point the errors stopped being quite as helpful, and it was no longer
obvious what to do next.  I had to resort to trial and error.  Still, the 
tests did at least tell me when I was getting things more right or more wrong.

My first attempts to use `get_form_kwargs` didn't really work, but I found
that I could use `get_form`:

----
    def get_form(self, form_class):
        self.object = self.get_object()
        return form_class(for_list=self.object, data=self.request.POST)
----

But it would only work if I also assigned to `self.object`, as a side-effect,
along the way, which was a bit upsetting.  Still, that takes us down
to just 3 errors, but we're still apparently not passing that form to the
template!

----
KeyError: 'form'

FAILED (errors=3)
----

Back on track
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A bit more experimenting led me to swap out the `DetailView` for a 
`SingleObjectMixin` (the docs had some useful pointers here):

----
from django.views.generic.detail import SingleObjectMixin
[...]

class ViewAndAddToList(CreateView, SingleObjectMixin):
    [...]
----

That takes us down to just two errors:

----
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: No URL to redirect to.  Either
provide a url or define a get_absolute_url method on the Model.
----

And for this final failure, the tests are being helpful again.
It's quite easy to define a `get_absolute_url` on the `Item` class, such
that items point to their parent list's page:


.lists/models.py
[source,python]
----
class Item(models.Model):
    [...]

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('view_list', args=[self.list.id])
----


Is that your final answer?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We end up with a view class that looks like this:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch31l010)
[source,python]
----
class ViewAndAddToList(CreateView, SingleObjectMixin):
    template_name = 'list.html'
    model = List
    form_class = ExistingListItemForm

    def get_form(self, form_class):
        self.object = self.get_object()
        return form_class(for_list=self.object, data=self.request.POST)
----


Compare old and new
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's see the old version for comparison?

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def view_list(request, list_id):
    list_ = List.objects.get(id=list_id)
    form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=list_)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ExistingListItemForm(for_list=list_, data=request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect(list_)
    return render(request, 'list.html', {'list': list_, "form": form})
----

Well, it has reduced the number of lines of code from 9 to 7.  Still, I find
the function-based version a little easier to understand, in that it has a
little bit less magic -- "explicit is better than implicit", as the Zen of
Python would have it. I mean... `SingleObjectMixin`?  What?  And, more
offensively, the whole thing falls apart if we don't assign to `self.object`
inside `get_form`?  yuck.

Still, I guess some of it is in the eye of the beholder.


Best practices for unit testing CBGVs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As I was working through this, I felt like my "unit" tests were sometimes a 
little too high-level.  This is no surprise, since tests for views that involve
the Django Test Client are probably more properly called Integration tests.

They told me whether I was getting things right or wrong, but they didn't
always offer enough clues on exactly how to fix things.

I occasionally wondered whether there might be some mileage in a test that
was closer to the implementation -- something like this:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
[source,python]
----
def test_cbv_gets_correct_object(self):
    our_list = List.objects.create()
    view = ViewAndAddToList()
    view.kwargs = dict(pk=our_list.id)
    self.assertEqual(view.get_object(), our_list)
----

But the problem is that it requires a lot of knowledge of the internals of
Django CBVs to be able to do the right test setup for these kinds of tests.
And you still end up getting very confused by the complex inheritance 
hierarchy.


Take-home: having multiple, isolated view test with single assertions helps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One thing I definitely did conclude from this chapter was that having many
short unit tests for views was much more helpful than having few tests with
a narrative series of assertions.

One monolithic test like this:


[role="sourcecode skipme"]
[source,python]
----
def test_validation_errors_sent_back_to_home_page_template(self):
    response = self.client.post('/lists/new', data={'text': ''})
    self.assertEqual(List.objects.all().count(), 0)
    self.assertEqual(Item.objects.all().count(), 0)
    self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'home.html')
    expected_error = escape("You can't have an empty list item")
    self.assertContains(response, expected_error)
----

Was definitely less useful than having three individual tests, like this:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
[source,python]
----
    def test_invalid_input_means_nothing_saved_to_db(self):
        self.post_invalid_input()
        self.assertequal(item.objects.all().count(), 0)

    def test_invalid_input_renders_list_template(self):
        response = self.post_invalid_input()
        self.asserttemplateused(response, 'list.html')

    def test_invalid_input_renders_form_with_errors(self):
        response = self.post_invalid_input()
        self.assertisinstance(response.context['form'], existinglistitemform)
        self.assertcontains(response, escape(empty_list_error))
----

The reason is that, in the first case, an early failure means not all the
assertions are checked.  So, if the view was accidentally saving to the
database on invalid POST, you would get an early fail, and so you wouldn't
find out whether it was using the right template or rendering the form.  The
second formulation makes it much easier to pick out exactly what was or wasn't
working.


.Lessons learned from CBGVs
*******************************************************************************

Class-Based Generic Views can do anything::
    It might not always be clear what's going on, but you can do just about
    anything with class-based views.

Single-assertion unit tests help refactoring::
    With each unit test providing individual guidance on what works and what
    doesn't, it's much easier to change the implementation of our views to
    using this fundamentally different paradigm.
