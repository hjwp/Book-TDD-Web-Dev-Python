[[chapter-6]]
Getting to the Minimum Viable Site
----------------------------------



In this chapter we're going to address the problems we discovered at the end
of the last chapter. In the immediate, the problem of cleaning up after
functional test runs. Later, the more general problem, which is that
our design only allows for one global list.  I'll demonstrate a critical
TDD technique:  how to adapt existing code using an incremental, step-by-step
process which takes you from working code to working code. Testing Goat, not
Refactoring Cat.


Ensuring Test Isolation in Functional Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We ended the last chapter with a classic testing problem:  how to ensure
'isolation' between tests.  Each run of our functional tests was leaving list
items lying around in the database, and that would interfere with the test
results when you next ran the tests.

When we run 'unit' tests, the Django test runner automatically creates a brand
new test database (separate from the real one), which it can safely reset
before each individual test is run, and then throw away at the end.  But our
functional tests currently run against the "real" database, 'db.sqlite3'.

One way to tackle this would be to "roll our own" solution, and add some code
to 'functional_tests.py' which would do the cleaning up. The `setUp` and
`tearDown` methods are perfect for this sort of thing.

Since Django 1.4 though, there's a new class called `LiveServerTestCase` which
can do this work for you. It will automatically create a test database (just
like in a unit test run), and start up a development server for the functional
tests to run against. Although as a tool it has some limitations which we'll
need to work around later, it's dead useful at this stage, so let's check it
out.

`LiveServerTestCase` expects to be run by the Django test runner using
'manage.py'. As of Django 1.6, the test runner will find any files whose name
begins with 'test'.  To keep things neat and tidy, let's make a folder for
our functional tests, so that it looks a bit like an app. All Django needs is
for it to be a valid Python module (ie, one with a '__init__.py' in it):

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *mkdir functional_tests*
$ *touch functional_tests/__init__.py*
----

Then we 'move' our functional tests, from being a standalone file called
'functional_tests.py', to being the 'tests.py' of the `functional_tests` app.
We use *`git mv`* so that Git notices that we've moved the file:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*git mv functional_tests.py functional_tests/tests.py*]
$ pass:quotes[*git status*] # shows the rename to functional_tests/tests.py and __init__.py
----

At this point your directory tree should look like this:

----
.
├── db.sqlite3
├── functional_tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── tests.py
├── lists
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── migrations
│   │   ├── 0001_initial.py
│   │   ├── 0002_item_text.py
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── __pycache__
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── __pycache__
│   ├── templates
│   │   └── home.html
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
├── manage.py
└── superlists
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── __pycache__
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py
----

'functional_tests.py' is gone, and has turned into 'functional_tests/tests.py'.
Now, whenever we want to run our functional tests, instead of running `python3
functional_tests.py`, we will use `python3 manage.py test functional_tests`.

NOTE: You could mix your functional tests into the tests for the `lists` app.
I tend to prefer to keep them separate, because functional tests usually have
cross-cutting concerns that run across different apps.  FTs are meant to see
things from the point of view of your users, and your users don't care about
how you've split work between different apps!

Now let's edit 'functional_tests/tests.py' and change our `NewVisitorTest`
class to make it use `LiveServerTestCase`:


[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py (ch06l001)
[source,python]
----
from django.test import LiveServerTestCase
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

class NewVisitorTest(LiveServerTestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        [...]
----

Next,footnote:[Are you unable to move on because you're wondering what those
'ch06l0xx' things are, next to some of the code listings?  They refer to
specific
https://github.com/hjwp/book-example/commits/chapter_06[commits]
in the book's example repo.  It's all to do with my book's correctness
tests.  You know, the tests for the tests in the book about testing.
They have tests of their own, incidentally.]
instead of hardcoding the visit to localhost port 8000, `LiveServerTestCase`
gives us an attribute called `live_server_url`:


[role="dofirst-ch06l003 sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py (ch06l002)
[source,python]
----
    def test_can_start_a_list_and_retrieve_it_later(self):
        # Edith has heard about a cool new online to-do app. She goes
        # to check out its homepage
        self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
----

We can also remove the `if __name__ == '__main__'` from the end if we want,
since we'll be using the Django test runner to launch the FT.

Now we are able to run our functional tests using the Django test runner, by
telling it to run just the tests for our new `functional_tests` app:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests*]
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
F
======================================================================
FAIL: test_can_start_a_list_and_retrieve_it_later
(functional_tests.tests.NewVisitorTest)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspace/superlists/functional_tests/tests.py", line 61, in
test_can_start_a_list_and_retrieve_it_later
    self.fail('Finish the test!')
AssertionError: Finish the test!

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 6.378s

FAILED (failures=1)
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
----

The FT gets through to the `self.fail`, just like it did before the refactor.
You'll also notice that if you run the tests a second time, there aren't any
old list items lying around from the previous test--it has cleaned up after
itself.  Success! We should commit it as an atomic change:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status* # functional_tests.py renamed + modified, new __init__.py
$ *git add functional_tests*
$ *git diff --staged -M*
$ *git commit*  # msg eg "make functional_tests an app, use LiveServerTestCase"
----

The `-M` flag on the `git diff` is a useful one. It means "detect moves," so it
will notice that 'functional_tests.py' and 'functional_tests/tests.py' are the
same file, and show you a more sensible diff (try it without the flag!).


Running Just the Unit Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now if we run `manage.py test`, Django will run both the functional and the
unit tests:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test*]
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
.......F
======================================================================

AssertionError: Finish the test!

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 8 tests in 3.132s

FAILED (failures=1)
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
----

In order to run just the unit tests, we can specify that we want to
only run the tests for the `lists` app:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test lists*]
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
.......
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 7 tests in 0.009s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
----



.Useful Commands Updated
*******************************************************************************
To run the functional tests::
    *`python3 manage.py test functional_tests`*

To run the unit tests::
    *`python3 manage.py test lists`*

What to do if I say "run the tests", and you're not sure which ones I mean?
Have another look at the flowchart at the end of <<chapter-4>>, and try and figure
out where we are.  As a rule of thumb, we usually only run the functional tests
once all the unit tests are passing, so if in doubt, try both!

*******************************************************************************

Now let's move on to thinking about how we want support for multiple lists to
work.  Currently the FT (which is the closest we have to a design document)
says this:

[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py
[source,python]
----
    # Edith wonders whether the site will remember her list. Then she sees
    # that the site has generate a unique URL for her -- there is some
    # explanatory text to that effect.
    self.fail('Finish the test!')

    # She visits that URL - her to-do list is still there.

    # Satisfied, she goes back to sleep
----

But really we want to expand on this, by saying that different users
don't see each other's lists, and each get their own URL as a way of
going back to their saved lists.  Let's think about this a bit more.


Small Design When Necessary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TDD is closely associated with the agile movement in software development,
which includes a reaction against 'Big Design Up Front' the
traditional software engineering practice whereby, after a lengthy requirements
gathering exercise, there is an equally lengthy design stage where the
software is planned out on paper. The agile philosophy is that you learn more
from solving problems in practice than in theory, especially when you confront
your application with real users as soon as possible. Instead of a long
up-front design phase, we try and put a 'minimum viable application' out
there early, and let the design evolve gradually based on feedback from
real-world usage.

But that doesn't mean that thinking about design is outright banned! In the
last chapter we saw how just blundering ahead without thinking can 'eventually'
get us to the right answer, but often a little thinking about design can help
us get there faster. So, let's think about our minimum viable lists app, and
what kind of design we'll need to deliver it.

* We want each user to be able to store their own list--at least one, for now.
* A list is made up of several items, whose primary attribute is a bit of
descriptive text.
* We need to save lists from one visit to the next.  For now, we can give
each user a unique URL for their list.  Later on we may want some way of
automatically recognising users and showing them their lists.

To deliver the "for now" items, it sounds like we're going to store
lists and their items in a database.  Each list will have a unique URL,
and each list item will be a bit of descriptive text, associated with a
particular list.

YAGNI!
^^^^^^

Once you start thinking about design, it can be hard to stop. All sorts of
other thoughts are occurring to us--we might want to give each list
a name or title, we might want to recognise users using usernames and
passwords, we might want to add a longer notes field as well as short
descriptions to our list, we might want to store some kind of ordering, and so
on.  But we obey another tenet of the agile gospel:  "YAGNI" (pronounced
yag-knee), which stands for "You aint gonna need it!"  As software
developers, we have fun creating things, and sometimes it's hard to resist
the urge to build things just because an idea occurred to us and we 'might'
need it.  The trouble is that more often than not, no matter how cool the idea
was, you 'won't' end up using it. Instead you have a load of unused code,
adding to the complexity of your application. YAGNI is the mantra we use to
resist our overenthusiastic creative urges.


REST
^^^^

We have an idea of the data structure we want--the Model part of
Model-View-Controller (MVC).  What about the View and Controller parts?
How should the user interact with Lists and their Items using a web browser?

Representational State Transfer (REST) is an approach to web design that's
usually used to guide the design of web-based APIs. When designing a
user-facing site, it's not possible to stick 'strictly' to the REST rules,
but they still provide some useful inspiration.

REST suggests that we have a URL structure that matches our data structure,
in this case lists and list items.  Each list can have its own URL:

[role="skipme"]
----
    /lists/<list identifier>/
----

That will fulfill the requirement we've specified in our FT. To view a list, we
use a GET request (a normal browser visit to the page).

To create a brand new list, we'll have a special URL that accepts POST
requests:

[role="skipme"]
----
    /lists/new
----

To add a new item to an existing list, we'll have a separate URL, to which
we can send POST requests:

[role="skipme"]
----
    /lists/<list identifier>/add_item
----

(Again, we're not trying to perfectly follow the rules of REST, which would
use a PUT request here--we're just using REST for inspiration.)

In summary, our scratchpad for this chapter looks something like this:

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Get FTs to clean up after themselves#'
* 'Adjust model so that items are associated with different lists'
* 'Add unique URLs for each list'
* 'Add a URL for creating a new list via POST'
* 'Add URLs for adding a new item to an existing list via POST'
*****

Implementing the New Design Using TDD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How do we use TDD to implement the new design? Let's take another look at
the flowchart for the TDD process in <<TDD-double-loop>>.

[[TDD-double-loop]]
.The TDD process with functional and unit tests
image::images/twdp_0601.png[A flowchart showing functional tests as the overall cycle, and unit tests helping to code. Tests passing and failing are marked as green and red respectively]
//TODO: address some capitalisation / punctuation issues here.

At the top level, we're going to use a combination of adding new functionality
(by extending the FT and writing new application code), and refactoring our
application--ie, rewriting some of the existing implementation so that it
delivers the same functionality to the user but using aspects of our new
design. At the unit test level, we'll be adding new tests or modifying existing
ones to test for the changes we want, and we'll be able to use the untouched
unit tests to make sure we don't break anything in the process.

Let's translate our scratchpad into our functional test.  As soon as Edith
submits a first list item, we'll want to create a new list, adding one
item to it, and take her to the URL for her list.  Look for the point
at which we say `inputbox.send_keys('Buy peacock feathers')`, and amend
the next block of code like this:


[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py
[source,python]
----
    inputbox.send_keys('Buy peacock feathers')

    # When she hits enter, she is taken to a new URL,
    # and now the page lists "1: Buy peacock feathers" as an item in a
    # to-do list table
    inputbox.send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
    edith_list_url = self.browser.current_url
    self.assertRegex(edith_list_url, '/lists/.+') #<1>
    self.check_for_row_in_list_table('1: Buy peacock feathers')

    # There is still a text box inviting her to add another item. She
    [...]
----

<1> `assertRegex` is a helper function from `unittest` that checks
whether a string matches a regular expression. We use it to check that our new
REST-ish design has been implemented. Find out more in the
http://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html[`unittest` documentation].

Let's also change the end of the test and imagine a new user coming along.
We want to check that they don't see any of Edith's items when they visit
the home page, and that they get their own unique URL for their list.

Delete everything from the comments just before the `self.fail` (they say
"Edith wonders whether the site will remember her list ...") and replace
them with a new ending to our FT:


[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/tests.py
[source,python]
----
    [...]
    # The page updates again, and now shows both items on her list
    self.check_for_row_in_list_table('2: Use peacock feathers to make a fly')
    self.check_for_row_in_list_table('1: Buy peacock feathers')

    # Now a new user, Francis, comes along to the site.

    ## We use a new browser session to make sure that no information
    ## of Edith's is coming through from cookies etc #<1>
    self.browser.quit()
    self.browser = webdriver.Firefox()

    # Francis visits the home page.  There is no sign of Edith's
    # list
    self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
    page_text = self.browser.find_element_by_tag_name('body').text
    self.assertNotIn('Buy peacock feathers', page_text)
    self.assertNotIn('make a fly', page_text)

    # Francis starts a new list by entering a new item. He
    # is less interesting than Edith...
    inputbox = self.browser.find_element_by_id('id_new_item')
    inputbox.send_keys('Buy milk')
    inputbox.send_keys(Keys.ENTER)

    # Francis gets his own unique URL
    francis_list_url = self.browser.current_url
    self.assertRegex(francis_list_url, '/lists/.+')
    self.assertNotEqual(francis_list_url, edith_list_url)

    # Again, there is no trace of Edith's list
    page_text = self.browser.find_element_by_tag_name('body').text
    self.assertNotIn('Buy peacock feathers', page_text)
    self.assertIn('Buy milk', page_text)

    # Satisfied, they both go back to sleep
----

<1> I'm using the convention of double-hashes (`##`) to indicate
"meta-comments"--comments about 'how' the test is working and why--so
that we can distinguish them from regular comments in FTs which explain the
User Story. They're a message to our future selves, which might otherwise be
wondering why the heck we're quitting the browser and starting a new one...


Other than that, the changes are fairly self-explanatory. Let's see how they do
when we run our FTs:

----
AssertionError: Regex didn't match: '/lists/.+' not found in
'http://localhost:8081/'
----

As expected.  Let's do a commit, and then go and build some new models
and views:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git commit -a*
----

NOTE: I found the FTs hung when I tried to run them today.  It turns out I
needed to upgrade Selenium, with a `pip3 install --upgrade selenium`. You
may remember from the preface that it's important to have the latest version
of Selenium installed--it's only been a couple of months since I last
upgraded, and Selenium had gone up by six point versions.  If something weird is
happening, always try upgrading Selenium!


Iterating Towards the New Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Being all excited about our new design, I had an overwhelming urge to dive in
at this point and start changing 'models.py', which would have broken half the
unit tests, and then pile in and change almost every single line of code, all
in one go.  That's a natural urge, and TDD, as a discipline, is a constant
fight against it. Obey the Testing Goat, not Refactoring Cat!  We don't need to
implement our new, shiny design in a single big bang. Let's make small changes
that take us from a working state to a working state, with our design guiding
us gently at each stage.

There are four items on our to-do list. The FT, with its `Regexp didn't
match`, is telling us that the second item--giving lists their own URL and
identifier--is the one we should work on next. Let's have a go at fixing
that, and only that.

The URL comes from the redirect after POST.  In 'lists/tests.py', find
`test_home_page_redirects_after_POST`, and change the expected redirect
location:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
[source,python]
----
self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 302)
self.assertEqual(response['location'], '/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/')
----

Does that seem slightly strange?  Clearly, '/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world'
isn't a URL that's going to feature in the final design of our application. But
we're committed to changing one thing at a time.  While our application only
supports one list, this is the only URL that makes sense.  We're still moving
forwards, in that we'll have a different URL for our list and our home page,
which is a step along the way to a more REST-ful design. Later, when we have
multiple lists, it will be easy to change.

NOTE: Another way of thinking about it is as a problem-solving technique: our
    new URL design is currently not implemented, so it works for 0 items.
    Ultimately, we want to solve for 'n' items, but solving for 1 item is a
    good step along the way.

Running the unit tests gives us an expected fail:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test lists*]
[...]
AssertionError: '/' != '/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/'
----

We can go adjust our `home_page` view in 'lists/views.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def home_page(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        Item.objects.create(text=request.POST['item_text'])
        return redirect('/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/')

    items = Item.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'items': items})
----

Of course, that will now totally break the functional tests, because there is no
such URL on our site yet.  Sure enough, if you run them, you'll find they fail
just after trying to submit the first item, saying that they can't find the
list table; it's because URL '/the-only-list-in-the-world/' doesn't exist yet!

----
    self.check_for_row_in_list_table('1: Buy peacock feathers')
[...]
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: 'Unable to locate
element: {"method":"id","selector":"id_list_table"}' ; Stacktrace:
----

//IDEA: improve FT for better error messages when table missing

So, let's build a special URL for our one and only list.


Testing Views, Templates, and URLs Together with the Django Test Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In previous chapters we've used unit tests that check the URL resolution
explicitly, that test view functions by actually calling them, and that
check that views render templates correctly too.  Django actually
provides us with a little tool that can do all three at once, which we'll use
now.

I wanted to show you how to "roll your own" first, partially because it's
a better introduction to how Django works, but also because those techniques
are portable--you may not always use Django, but you'll almost always have
view functions, templates, and URL mappings, and now you know how to test them.


A New Test Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So let's use the Django test client.  Open up 'lists/tests.py', and add a new
test class called `ListViewTest`.  Then copy the method called
`test_home_page_displays_all_` `list_items` across from `HomePageTest` into our
new class, rename it, and adapt it slightly:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch06l009)
[source,python]
----
class ListViewTest(TestCase):

    def test_displays_all_items(self):
        Item.objects.create(text='itemey 1')
        Item.objects.create(text='itemey 2')

        response = self.client.get('/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/') #<1>

        self.assertContains(response, 'itemey 1') #<2>
        self.assertContains(response, 'itemey 2') #<2>

----

<1> Instead of calling the view function directly, we use the Django test
client, which is an attribute of the Django `TestCase` called `self.client`. We
tell it to `.get` the URL we're testing--it's actually a very similar API to
the one that Selenium uses.

<2> Instead of using the slightly annoying `assertIn`/+response.content.decode()+ dance, Django provides the `assertContains` method
which knows how to deal with responses and the bytes of their content.

NOTE: Some people really don't like the Django test client.  They say it
provides too much magic, and involves too much of the stack to be used in a
real "unit" test--you end up writing what are more properly called
integrated tests.  They also complain that it is relatively slow (and
relatively is measured in milliseconds). We'll explore this argument further in
a later chapter. For now we'll use it because it's extremely convenient!


Let's try running the test now:

----
AssertionError: 404 != 200 : Couldn't retrieve content: Response code was 404
----


A New URL
^^^^^^^^^

Our singleton list URL doesn't exist yet.  We fix that in 'superlists/urls.py'.

TIP: Watch out for trailing slashes in URLs, both here in the tests and in
'urls.py'--they're a common source of bugs.

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/urls.py
[source,python]
----
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^$', 'lists.views.home_page', name='home'),
    url(r'^lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/$', 'lists.views.view_list',
        name='view_list'
    ),
    # url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
)
----

Running the tests again, we get:

----
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'view_list'
[...]
django.core.exceptions.ViewDoesNotExist: Could not import
lists.views.view_list. View does not exist in module lists.views.
----

A New View Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nicely self-explanatory.  Let's create a dummy view function in 'lists/views.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def view_list(request):
    pass
----

Now we get:

----
ValueError: The view lists.views.view_list didn't return an HttpResponse
object. It returned None instead.
----

Let's copy the two last lines from the `home_page` view and see if they'll do
the trick:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def view_list(request):
    items = Item.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'items': items})
----

Rerun the tests and they should pass:

----
Ran 8 tests in 0.016s
OK
----

And the FTs should get a little further on:

----
AssertionError: '2: Use peacock feathers to make a fly' not found in ['1: Buy
peacock feathers']
----


Green? Refactor
+++++++++++++++

Time for a little tidying up.  

In the Red/Green/Refactor dance, we've arrived at green, so we should see what
needs a refactor.  We now have two views, one for the home page, and one for an
individual list.  Both are currently using the same template, and passing it
all the list items currently in the database.  If we look through our unit test
methods, we can see some stuff we probably want to change:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *grep -E "class|def" lists/tests.py*
class HomePageTest(TestCase):
    def test_root_url_resolves_to_home_page_view(self):
    def test_home_page_returns_correct_html(self):
    def test_home_page_displays_all_list_items(self):
    def test_home_page_can_save_a_POST_request(self):
    def test_home_page_redirects_after_POST(self):
    def test_home_page_only_saves_items_when_necessary(self):
class ListViewTest(TestCase):
    def test_displays_all_items(self):
class ItemModelTest(TestCase):
    def test_saving_and_retrieving_items(self):
----

We can definitely delete the `test_home_page_displays_all_list_items` method,
it's no longer needed.  If you run *`manage.py test lists`* now, it should say
it ran 7 tests instead of 8:

[role="dofirst-ch06l010"]
----
Ran 7 tests in 0.016s
OK
----

Next, we don't actually need the home page to display all list items any more;
it should just show a single input box inviting you to start a new list.


A Separate Template for Viewing Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since the home page and the list view are now quite distinct pages,
they should be using different HTML templates--'home.html' can have the
single input box, whereas a new template, 'list.html', can take care
of showing the table of existing items.

Let's add a new test test to check that it's using a different template:

//13
[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
[source,python]
----
class ListViewTest(TestCase):

    def test_uses_list_template(self):
        response = self.client.get('/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/')
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'list.html')


    def test_displays_all_items(self):
        [...]

----

`assertTemplateUsed` is one of the more useful functions that the Django test
client gives us.  Let's see what it says:

----
AssertionError: False is not true : Template 'list.html' was not a template
used to render the response. Actual template(s) used: home.html
----


Great!  Let's change the view:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def view_list(request):
    items = Item.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'list.html', {'items': items})
----

But, obviously, that template doesn't exist yet. If we run the unit tests, we
get:

----
django.template.base.TemplateDoesNotExist: list.html
----

Let's create a new file at 'lists/templates/list.html':

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *touch lists/templates/list.html*
----

A blank template, which gives us this error--good to know the tests are
there to make sure we fill it in:

----
AssertionError: False is not true : Couldn't find 'itemey 1' in response
----

The template for an individual list will reuse quite a lot of the stuff
we currently have in 'home.html', so we can start by just copying that:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *cp lists/templates/home.html lists/templates/list.html*
----

That gets the tests back to passing (green).  Now let's do a little more
tidying up (refactoring).  We said the home page doesn't need to list items, it
only needs the new list input field, so we can remove some lines from
'lists/templates/home.html', and maybe slightly tweak the `h1` to say "Start a
new To-Do list":

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html
[source,html]
----
<body>
    <h1>Start a new To-Do list</h1>
    <form method="POST">
        <input name="item_text" id="id_new_item" placeholder="Enter a to-do item" />
        {% csrf_token %}
    </form>
</body>
----

We rerun the unit tests to check that hasn't broken anything ... good...

There's actually no need to pass all the items to the 'home.html' template in
our `home_page` view, so we can simplify that:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def home_page(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        Item.objects.create(text=request.POST['item_text'])
        return redirect('/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/')
    return render(request, 'home.html')
----

Rerun the unit tests; they still pass. Let's run the functional tests:

----
AssertionError: '2: Use peacock feathers to make a fly' not found in ['1: Buy
peacock feathers']
----

We're still failing to input the second item.  What's going on here? Well, the
problem is that our new item forms are both missing an `action=` attribute,
which means that, by default, they submit to the same URL they were rendered
from. That works for the home page, because it's the only one that knows how to
deal with POST requests currently, but it won't work for our `view_list`
function, which is just ignoring the POST.

We can fix that in 'lists/templates/list.html':

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/list.html (ch06l019)
[source,html]
----
    <form method="POST" action="/">
----

And try running the FT again:

----
    self.assertNotEqual(francis_list_url, edith_list_url)
AssertionError: 'http://localhost:8081/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/' ==
'http://localhost:8081/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/'
----

Hooray! We're back to where we were earlier, which means our refactoring is
complete--we now have a unique URL for our one list.  It may feel like we
haven't made much headway since, functionally, the site still behaves almost
exactly like it did when we started the chapter, but this really is progress.
We've started on the road to our new design, and we've implemented a number of
stepping stones 'without making anything worse than it was before'.  Let's
commit our progress so far:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status* # should show 4 changed files and 1 new file, list.html
$ *git add lists/templates/list.html*
$ *git diff* # should show we've simplified home.html,
           # moved one test to a new class in lists/tests.py added a new view
           # in views.py, and simplified home_page and made one addition to
           # urls.py
$ *git commit -a* # add a message summarising the above, maybe something like
                # "new URL, view and template to display lists"
----


Another URL and View for Adding List Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where are we with our own to-do list?

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Get FTs to clean up after themselves#'
* 'Adjust model so that items are associated with different lists'
* 'Add unique URLs for each list'
* 'Add a URL for creating a new list via POST'
* 'Add URLs for adding a new item to an existing list via POST'
*****

We've 'sort of' made progress on the third item, even if there's still only one
list in the world. Item 2 is a bit scary.  Can we do something about items 4 or
5?  

Let's have a new URL for adding new list items.  If nothing else, it'll
simplify the home page view.


A Test Class for New List Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open up 'lists/tests.py', and 'move' the
`test_home_page_can_save_a_POST_request` and
`test_home_page_redirects_after_POST` methods into a new class, then change
their names:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch06l021-1)
[source,python]
----
class NewListTest(TestCase):

    def test_saving_a_POST_request(self):
        request = HttpRequest()
        request.method = 'POST'
        [...]

    def test_redirects_after_POST(self):
        [...]
----


Now let's use the Django test client:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch06l021-2)
[source,python]
----
class NewListTest(TestCase):

    def test_saving_a_POST_request(self):
        self.client.post(
            '/lists/new',
            data={'item_text': 'A new list item'}
        )
        self.assertEqual(Item.objects.count(), 1)
        new_item = Item.objects.first()
        self.assertEqual(new_item.text, 'A new list item')


    def test_redirects_after_POST(self):
        response = self.client.post(
            '/lists/new',
            data={'item_text': 'A new list item'}
        )
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 302)
        self.assertEqual(response['location'], '/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/')
----

This is another place to pay attention to trailing slashes, incidentally. It's
`/new`, with no trailing slash.  The convention I'm using is that URLs without
a trailing slash are "action" URLs which modify the database.

Try running that:

----
    self.assertEqual(Item.objects.count(), 1)
AssertionError: 0 != 1
[...]
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 302)
AssertionError: 404 != 302
----

The first failure tells us we're not saving a new item to the database, and the
second says that, instead of returning a 302 redirect, our view is returning a
404. That's because we haven't built a URL for '/lists/new', so the
`client.post` is just getting a 404 response.

NOTE: Do you remember how we split this out into two tests in the last chapter?
If we only had one test that checked both the saving and the redirect, it would
have failed on the `0 != 1` failure, which would have been much harder to
debug.  Ask me how I know this.


A URL and View for New List Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's build our new URL now:


//22
[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/urls.py
[source,python]
----
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^$', 'lists.views.home_page', name='home'),
    url(r'^lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/$', 'lists.views.view_list',
        name='view_list'
    ),
    url(r'^lists/new$', 'lists.views.new_list', name='new_list'),
    # url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
)
----

Next we get a `ViewDoesNotExist`, so let's fix that, in 'lists/views.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def new_list(request):
    pass
----

Then we get "The view lists.views.new_list didn't return an HttpResponse
object."  (This is getting rather familiar!)  We could return a raw
`HttpResponse`, but since we know we'll need a redirect, let's borrow a line
from `home_page`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def new_list(request):
    return redirect('/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/')
----

That gives:

----
    self.assertEqual(Item.objects.count(), 1)
AssertionError: 0 != 1
[...]
AssertionError: 'http://testserver/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/' !=
'/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/'
----

Let's start with the first failure, because it's reasonably straightforward. We
borrow another line from `home_page`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def new_list(request):
    Item.objects.create(text=request.POST['item_text'])
    return redirect('/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/')
----

And that takes us down to just the second, unexpected failure:

----
    self.assertEqual(response['location'],
'/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/')
AssertionError: 'http://testserver/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/' !=
'/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/'
----

It's happening because the Django test client behaves slightly differently to
our pure view function; it's using the full Django stack which adds the domain
to our relative URL.  Let's use another of Django's test helper functions,
instead of our two-step check for the redirect:

//22?
[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
[source,python]
----
    def test_redirects_after_POST(self):
        response = self.client.post(
            '/lists/new',
            data={'item_text': 'A new list item'}
        )
        self.assertRedirects(response, '/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/')
----

That now passes:

----
Ran 8 tests in 0.030s

OK
----


Removing Now-Redundant Code and Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We're looking good. Since our new views are now doing most of the work that
`home_page` used to do, we should be able to massively simplify it. Can we
remove the whole `if request.method == 'POST'` section, for example?

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def home_page(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html')
----

Yep!

----
OK
----

And while we're at it, we can remove the now-redundant
`test_home_page_only_saves_` `items_when_necessary` test too!

Doesn't that feel good?  The view functions are looking much simpler. We rerun
the tests to make sure...

[role="dofirst-ch06l026"]
----
Ran 7 tests in 0.016s
OK
----


Pointing Our Forms at the New URL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, let's wire up our two forms to use this new URL.  In 'both'
'home.html' and 'lists.html':

//ch06l027
[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/home.html, lists/templates/list.html
[source,html]
----
    <form method="POST" action="/lists/new">
----

And we rerun our FTs to make sure everything still works, or works at least as
well as it did earlier...

----
AssertionError: 'http://localhost:8081/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/' ==
'http://localhost:8081/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/'
----

Yup, we get to the same point we did before. That's a nicely self-contained
commit, in that we've made a bunch of changes to our URLs, our 'views.py' is
looking much neater and tidier, and we're sure the application is still
working as well as it did before.  We're getting good at this refactoring
malarkey!

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status* # 5 changed files
$ *git diff* # URLs for forms x2, moved code in views + tests, new URL
$ *git commit -a*
----

And we can cross out an item on the to-do list:

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Get FTs to clean up after themselves#'
* 'Adjust model so that items are associated with different lists'
* 'Add unique URLs for each list'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Add a URL for creating a new list via POST#'
* 'Add URLs for adding a new item to an existing list via POST'
*****

Adjusting our Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enough housekeeping with our URLs. It's time to bite the bullet and
change our models.  Let's adjust the model unit test. Just for a change, I'll
present the changes in the form of a diff:

----

We create a new `List` object, and then we assign each item to it
by assigning it as its `.list` property.  We check the list is properly
saved, and we check that the two items have also saved their relationship
to the list.  You'll also notice that we can compare list objects with each
other directly (`saved_list` and `list`)--behind the scenes, these
will compare themselves by checking their primary key (the `.id` attribute)
is the same.

NOTE: I'm using the variable name `list_` to avoid "shadowing" the Python
built-in `list` function.  It's ugly, but all the other options I tried were
equally ugly or worse (`my_list`, `the_list`, `list1`, `listey`...).

Time for another unit-test/code cycle.   

For the first couple of iterations, rather than explicitly showing you what
code to enter in between every test run, I'm only going to show you the
expected error messages from running the tests.  I'll let you figure out what
each minimal code change should be on your own:

Your first error should be:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
ImportError: cannot import name 'List'
----

Fix that, then you should see:

[role="dofirst-ch06l029-1"]
----
AttributeError: 'List' object has no attribute 'save'
----

Next you should see:

[role="dofirst-ch06l029-2"]
----
django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: lists_list
----

So we run a `makemigrations`:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'lists':
  0003_list.py:
    - Create model List
----

And then you should see:

----
    self.assertEqual(first_saved_item.list, list_)
AttributeError: 'Item' object has no attribute 'list'
----


A Foreign Key Relationship
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How do we give our `Item` a list attribute?  Let's just try naively making it
like the `text` attribute:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/models.py
[source,python]
----
from django.db import models

class List(models.Model):
    pass

class Item(models.Model):
    text = models.TextField(default='')
    list = models.TextField(default='')
----
//029-4

As usual, the tests tell us we need a migration:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test lists*]
[...]
django.db.utils.OperationalError: table lists_item has no column named list

$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'lists':
  0004_item_list.py:
    - Add field list to item
----


Let's see what that gives us:

----
AssertionError: 'List object' != <List: List object>
----


We're not quite there. Look closely at each side of the `!=`.  Django has only
saved the string representation of the `List` object. To save the relationship to
the object itself, we tell Django about the relationship between the two
classes using a `ForeignKey`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/models.py
[source,python]
----
from django.db import models

class List(models.Model):
    pass


class Item(models.Model):
    text = models.TextField(default='')
    list = models.ForeignKey(List, default=None)
----
//029-5

//TODO: explain default=None

That'll need a migration too.  Since the last one was a red herring, let's
delete it and replace it with a new one:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*rm lists/migrations/0004_item_list.py*]
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py makemigrations*]
Migrations for 'lists':
  0004_item_list.py:
    - Add field list to item
----


WARNING: Deleting migrations is dangerous. If you delete a migration that's
    already been applied to a database somewhere, Django will be confused about
    what state it's in, and how to apply future migrations. You should only do
    it when you're sure the migration hasn't been used.  A good rule of thumb
    is that you should never delete a migration that's been committed to your
    VCS. 



Adjusting the Rest of the World to Our New Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Back in our tests, now what happens?

----

Oh dear!  

There is some good news. Although it's hard to see, our model tests are
passing.  But three of our view tests are failing nastily.

The reason is because of the new relationship we've introduced between
Items and Lists, which requires each list to have a parent item, which 
our old tests weren't prepared for.

Still, this is exactly why we have tests. Let's get them working again.  The
easiest is the `ListViewTest`; we just create a parent list for our two test
items:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch06l031)

That gets us down to two failing tests, both on tests that try to POST to our
`new_list` view. Decoding the tracebacks using our usual technique, working back
from error, to line of test code, to the line of our own code that caused the
failure, we identify:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
File "/workspace/superlists/lists/views.py", line 14, in new_list
Item.objects.create(text=request.POST['item_text'])
----
//shld line 14 be line 9?

It's when we try and create an item without a parent list. So we make a similar
change in the view:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
from lists.models import Item, List
[...]
def new_list(request):
    list_ = List.objects.create()
    Item.objects.create(text=request.POST['item_text'], list=list_)
    return redirect('/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/')
----

And that gets our tests passing again:

----
OK
----

Are you cringing internally at this point?  'Arg! This feels so wrong, we
create a new list for every single new item submission, and we're still just
displaying all items as if they belong to the same list!'
I know, I feel the same.  The step-by-step approach, in which you go
from working code to working code, is counterintuitive. I always feel like
just diving in and trying to fix everything all in one go, instead of going
from one weird half-finished state to another.  But remember the Testing Goat!
When you're up a mountain, you want to think very carefully about where you put
each foot, and take one step at a time, checking at each stage that the place
you've put it hasn't caused you to fall off a cliff.

So just to reassure ourselves that things have worked, we rerun the FT.  Sure
enough, it gets all the way through to where we were before.  We haven't broken
anything, and we've made a change to the database.  That's something to be
pleased with! Let's commit:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status* # 3 changed files, plus 2 migrations
$ *git add lists*
$ *git diff --staged*
$ *git commit*
----

And we can cross out another item on the to-do list:

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Get FTs to clean up after themselves#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Adjust model so that items are associated with different lists#'
* 'Add unique URLs for each list'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Add a URL for creating a new list via POST#'
* 'Add URLs for adding a new item to an existing list via POST'
*****

Each List Should Have Its Own URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What shall we use as the unique identifier for our lists?  Probably the
simplest thing, for now, is just to use the auto-generated `id` field from the
database. Let's change `ListViewTest` so that the two tests point at new
URLs.

We'll also change the old `test_displays_all_items` test and call it
`test_displays_only_items_for_that_list` instead, and make it check that
only the items for a specific list are displayed:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch06l033-1)
[source,python]
----
class ListViewTest(TestCase):

    def test_uses_list_template(self):
        list_ = List.objects.create()
        response = self.client.get('/lists/%d/' % (list_.id,))
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'list.html')


    def test_displays_only_items_for_that_list(self):
        correct_list = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(text='itemey 1', list=correct_list)
        Item.objects.create(text='itemey 2', list=correct_list)
        other_list = List.objects.create()
        Item.objects.create(text='other list item 1', list=other_list)
        Item.objects.create(text='other list item 2', list=other_list)

        response = self.client.get('/lists/%d/' % (correct_list.id,))

        self.assertContains(response, 'itemey 1')
        self.assertContains(response, 'itemey 2')
        self.assertNotContains(response, 'other list item 1')
        self.assertNotContains(response, 'other list item 2')
----


NOTE: If you're not familiar with Python string substitutions, or the
`printf` function from C, maybe that `%d` is a little confusing?
http://www.diveintopython.net/['Dive Into Python'] has a good overview, if you
want to go look them up quickly.  We'll see an alternative string substitution
syntax later in the book too.

Running the unit tests gives an expected 404, and another related error:

----
FAIL: test_displays_only_items_for_that_list (lists.tests.ListViewTest)
AssertionError: 404 != 200 : Couldn't retrieve content: Response code was 404
(expected 200)
[...]
FAIL: test_uses_list_template (lists.tests.ListViewTest)
AssertionError: No templates used to render the response
----


Capturing Parameters from URLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's time to learn how we can pass parameters from URLs to views:


[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/urls.py
[source,python]
----
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^$', 'lists.views.home_page', name='home'),
    url(r'^lists/(.+)/$', 'lists.views.view_list', name='view_list'),
    url(r'^lists/new$', 'lists.views.new_list', name='new_list'),
    # url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
)
----

We adjust the regular expression for our URL to include a 'capture group',
`(.+)`, which will match any characters, up to the following `/`. The captured
text will get passed to the view as an argument.

In other words, if we go to the URL '/lists/1/', `view_list` will get a second
argument after the normal `request` argument, namely the string `"1"`.
If we go to '/lists/foo/', we get `view_list(request, "foo")`.

But our view doesn't expect an argument yet! Sure enough, this causes problems:

----
ERROR: test_displays_only_items_for_that_list (lists.tests.ListViewTest)
ERROR: test_uses_list_template (lists.tests.ListViewTest)
ERROR: test_redirects_after_POST (lists.tests.NewListTest)
[...]
TypeError: view_list() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
----

We can fix that easily with a dummy parameter in 'views.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def view_list(request, list_id):
    [...]
----

Now we're down to our expected failure:

----
FAIL: test_displays_only_items_for_that_list (lists.tests.ListViewTest)
AssertionError: 1 != 0 : Response should not contain 'other list item 1'
----

Let's make our view discriminate over which items it sends to the
template:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def view_list(request, list_id):
    list_ = List.objects.get(id=list_id)
    items = Item.objects.filter(list=list_)
    return render(request, 'list.html', {'items': items})
----


Adjusting new_list to the New World
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we get errors in another test:

----
ERROR: test_redirects_after_POST (lists.tests.NewListTest)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10:
'the-only-list-in-the-world'
----

Let's take a look at this test then, since it's whining:


[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.lists/tests.py
[source,python]
----
class NewListTest(TestCase):
    [...]

    def test_redirects_after_POST(self):
        response = self.client.post(
            '/lists/new',
            data={'item_text': 'A new list item'}
        )
        self.assertRedirects(response, '/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/')
----

It looks like it hasn't been adjusted to the new world of Lists and Items.
The test should be saying that this view redirects to the URL of the new list
it just created:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch06l036-1)
[source,python]
----
    def test_redirects_after_POST(self):
        response = self.client.post(
            '/lists/new',
            data={'item_text': 'A new list item'}
        )
        new_list = List.objects.first()
        self.assertRedirects(response, '/lists/%d/' % (new_list.id,))
----

That still gives us the 'invalid literal' error. We take a look at the view
itself, and change it so it redirects to a valid place:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py (ch06l036-2)
[source,python]
----
def new_list(request):
    list_ = List.objects.create()
    Item.objects.create(text=request.POST['item_text'], list=list_)
    return redirect('/lists/%d/' % (list_.id,))
----

That gets us back to passing unit tests.  What about the functional
tests?  We must be almost there?

----
AssertionError: '2: Use peacock feathers to make a fly' not found in ['1: Use
peacock feathers to make a fly']
----

The functional tests have warned us of a regression in our application: because
we're now creating a new list for every single POST submission, we have broken
the ability to add multiple items to a list.  This is exactly what we have
functional tests for!

And it correlates nicely with the last item on our to-do list:

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Get FTs to clean up after themselves#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Adjust model so that items are associated with different lists#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Add unique URLs for each list#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Add a URL for creating a new list via POST#'
* 'Add URLs for adding a new item to an existing list via POST'
*****


One More View to Handle Adding Items to an Existing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We need a URL and view to handle adding a new item to an existing list (
'/lists/<list_id>/add_item').  We're getting pretty good at these now, so let's
knock one together quickly:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
[source,python]
----
class NewItemTest(TestCase):

    def test_can_save_a_POST_request_to_an_existing_list(self):
        other_list = List.objects.create()
        correct_list = List.objects.create()

        self.client.post(
            '/lists/%d/add_item' % (correct_list.id,),
            data={'item_text': 'A new item for an existing list'}
        )

        self.assertEqual(Item.objects.count(), 1)
        new_item = Item.objects.first()
        self.assertEqual(new_item.text, 'A new item for an existing list')
        self.assertEqual(new_item.list, correct_list)


    def test_redirects_to_list_view(self):
        other_list = List.objects.create()
        correct_list = List.objects.create()

        response = self.client.post(
            '/lists/%d/add_item' % (correct_list.id,),
            data={'item_text': 'A new item for an existing list'}
        )

        self.assertRedirects(response, '/lists/%d/' % (correct_list.id,))
----

We get:

----
AssertionError: 0 != 1
[...]
AssertionError: 301 != 302 : Response didn't redirect as expected: Response
code was 301 (expected 302)
----


Beware of Greedy Regular Expressions!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That's a little strange. We haven't actually specified a URL for
'/lists/1/add_item' yet, so our expected failure is `404 != 302`.  Why are we
getting a 301?

This was a bit of a puzzler, but it's because we've used a very "greedy"
regular expression in our URL:


[role="skipme"]
[source,python]
----
    url(r'^lists/(.+)/$', 'lists.views.view_list', name='view_list'),
----

Django has some built-in code to issue a permanent redirect (301) whenever
someone asks for a URL which is 'almost' right, except for a missing slash.
In this case, '/lists/1/add_item/' would be a match for `lists/(.+)/`, with
the `(.+)` capturing `1/add_item`.  So Django "helpfully" guesses that we
actually wanted the URL with a trailing slash.

We can fix that by making our URL pattern explicitly capture only numerical
digits, by using the regular expression `\d`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/urls.py
[source,python]
----
    url(r'^lists/(\d+)/$', 'lists.views.view_list', name='view_list'),
----

That gives:

----
AssertionError: 0 != 1
[...]
AssertionError: 404 != 302 : Response didn't redirect as expected: Response
code was 404 (expected 302)
----

The Last New URL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we've got our expected 404, let's add a new URL for adding new items to
existing lists:

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/urls.py
[source,python]
----
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^$', 'lists.views.home_page', name='home'),
    url(r'^lists/(\d+)/$', 'lists.views.view_list', name='view_list'),
    url(r'^lists/(\d+)/add_item$', 'lists.views.add_item', name='add_item'),
    url(r'^lists/new$', 'lists.views.new_list', name='new_list'),
    # url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
)
----

Three very similar-looking URLs there.  Let's make a note on our
to-do list; they look like good candidates for a refactoring.

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Get FTs to clean up after themselves#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Adjust model so that items are associated with different lists#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Add unique URLs for each list#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Add a URL for creating a new list via POST#'
* 'Add URLs for adding a new item to an existing list via POST'
* 'Refactor away some duplication in urls.py'
*****


Back to the tests, we now get:

----
django.core.exceptions.ViewDoesNotExist: Could not import lists.views.add_item.
View does not exist in module lists.views.
----


The Last New View
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's try:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def add_item(request):
    pass
----

Aha:

----
TypeError: add_item() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
----


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def add_item(request, list_id):
    pass
----

And then:

----
ValueError: The view lists.views.add_item didn't return an HttpResponse object.
It returned None instead.
----


We can copy the `redirect` from `new_list` and the `List.objects.get` from
`view_list`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def add_item(request, list_id):
    list_ = List.objects.get(id=list_id)
    return redirect('/lists/%d/' % (list_.id,))
----

That takes us to:

----
    self.assertEqual(Item.objects.count(), 1)
AssertionError: 0 != 1
----

Finally we make it save our new list item:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def add_item(request, list_id):
    list_ = List.objects.get(id=list_id)
    Item.objects.create(text=request.POST['item_text'], list=list_)
    return redirect('/lists/%d/' % (list_.id,))
----

That's the tests passing.

----
Ran 9 tests in 0.050s

OK
----


But How to Use that URL in the Form?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we just need to use this URL in our 'list.html' template.  Open it up and
adjust the form tag...

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.lists/templates/list.html
[source,html]
----
    <form method="POST" action="but what should we put here?">
----


\... oh. To get the URL for adding to the current list, the template needs to
know what list it's rendering, as well as what the items are.  We want to
be able to do something like this:

[role="sourcecode skipme"]
.lists/templates/list.html
[source,html]
----
    <form method="POST" action="/lists/{{ list.id }}/add_item">
----


For that to work, the view will have to pass the list to the template.
Let's create a new unit test in `ListViewTest`:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py (ch06l041)
[source,python]
----
    def test_passes_correct_list_to_template(self):
        other_list = List.objects.create()
        correct_list = List.objects.create()
        response = self.client.get('/lists/%d/' % (correct_list.id,))
        self.assertEqual(response.context['list'], correct_list)
----

//IDEA: explain correct_list, other_list


`response.context` represents the context we're going to pass into
the render function--the Django test client puts it on the `response`
object for us, to help with testing. That gives us:

----
KeyError: 'list'
----

because we're not passing `list` into the template.  It actually gives us an
opportunity to simplify a little:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
[source,python]
----
def view_list(request, list_id):
    list_ = List.objects.get(id=list_id)
    return render(request, 'list.html', {'list': list_})
----

That, of course, will break because the template is expecting `items`:

----
AssertionError: False is not true : Couldn't find 'itemey 1' in response
----

But we can fix it in 'list.html', as well as adjusting the form's POST action:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/list.html (ch06l043)
[source,html]
----
    <form method="POST" action="/lists/{{ list.id }}/add_item">

    [...]

        {% for item in list.item_set.all %}
            <tr><td>{{ forloop.counter }}: {{ item.text }}</td></tr>
        {% endfor %}
----

`.item_set` is called a "reverse lookup"--it's one of Django's incredibly
useful bits of ORM that lets you look up an object's related items from a
different table...

So that gets the unit tests to pass:

----
Ran 10 tests in 0.060s

OK
----

How about the FT?

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python3 manage.py test functional_tests*]
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 5.824s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
----

Yes!  And a quick check on our to-do list:

[role="scratchpad"]
*****
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Get FTs to clean up after themselves#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Adjust model so that items are associated with different lists#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Add unique URLs for each list#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Add a URL for creating a new list via POST#'
* '[strikethrough line-through]#Add URLs for adding a new item to an existing list via POST#'
* 'Refactor away some duplication in urls.py'
*****

Irritatingly, the Testing Goat is a stickler for tying up loose ends too, so
we've got to do this one final thing.

Before we start, we'll do a commit--always make sure you've got a commit
of a working state before embarking on a refactor:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff*
$ *git commit -am "new URL + view for adding to existing lists. FT passes :-)"*
----

A Final Refactor Using URL includes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'superlists/urls.py' is really meant for URLs that apply to your
entire site.  For URLs that only apply to the `lists` app, Django encourages us
to use a separate 'lists/urls.py', to make the app more self-contained.  The
simplest way to make one is to use a copy of the existing 'urls.py':

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *cp superlists/urls.py lists/*
----

Then we replace three lines in 'superlists/urls.py' with an `include`.  Notice
that `include` can take a part of a URL regex as a prefix, which will be
applied to all the included URLs (this is the bit where we reduce duplication,
as well as giving our code a better structure):

[role="sourcecode"]
.superlists/urls.py
[source,python]
----
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^$', 'lists.views.home_page', name='home'),
    url(r'^lists/', include('lists.urls')),
    # url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
)
----

And 'lists/urls.py' we can trim down to only include the latter part
of our three URLs, and none of the other stuff from the parent 'urls.py':



[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/urls.py (ch06l045)
[source,python]
----
from django.conf.urls import patterns, url

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^(\d+)/$', 'lists.views.view_list', name='view_list'),
    url(r'^(\d+)/add_item$', 'lists.views.add_item', name='add_item'),
    url(r'^new$', 'lists.views.new_list', name='new_list'),
)
----

Rerun the unit tests to check everything worked.  When I did it, I
couldn't quite believe I did it correctly on the first go. It always pays to be
skeptical of your own abilities, so I deliberately changed one of the URLs
slightly, just to check if it broke a test. It did. We're covered.

Feel free to try it yourself!  Remember to change it back, check the tests
all pass again, and then commit:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status*
$ *git add lists/urls.py*
$ *git add superlists/urls.py*
$ *git diff --staged*
$ *git commit*
----

Phew. A marathon chapter. But we covered a number of important topics, starting
with test isolation, and then some thinking about design. We covered some rules
of thumb like "YAGNI" and "three strikes then refactor". But, most importantly,
we saw how to adapt an existing site step by step, going from working state to
working state, in order to iterate towards a new design.

I'd say we're pretty close to being able to ship this site, as the very first
beta of the superlists website that's going to take over the world.  Maybe it
needs a little prettification first ... let's look at what we need to do to
deploy it in the next couple of chapters.



.Useful TDD Concepts
*******************************************************************************

Test isolation::
    Different tests shouldn't affect one another.  This means we need to
    reset any permanent state at the end of each test. Django's test runner
    helps us do this by creating a test database, which it wipes clean in
    between each test.

The Testing Goat vs. Refactoring Cat::
    Our natural urge is often to dive in and fix everything at once ... but if
    we're not careful, we'll end up like Refactoring Cat, in a situation with
    loads of changes to our code and nothing working.  The Testing Goat
    encourages us to take one step at a time, and go from working state to
    working state.

//TODO: add YAGNI

*******************************************************************************
